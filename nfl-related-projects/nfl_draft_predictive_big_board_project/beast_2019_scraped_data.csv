"DWAYNE HASKINS","QB","Ohio State",7,"5/3/1997","21.99","rSO",75.375,"231","Potomac, Md.","Bullis School","A four-star quarterback recruit out of high school, Dwayne Haskins Jr. grew up in New Jersey before moving to Gaithersburg, Maryland prior to his freshman year in high school to attend Bullis School. He became the starting quarterback there as a sophomore and quickly emerged as one of the top prep passers in the country. After earning Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year honors as a junior, Haskins completed 59.4 percent of his passes (170-of-286) for 2,217 yards and 20 touchdowns, earning consensus First Team All-State honors and finishing his career with 5,308 passing yards and 54 touchdowns. He was the No. 7 ranked pro-style passer in the 2016 recruiting cycle and initially recruited to Maryland during his junior year. However, two things changed: Maryland fired the previous coaching staff, including current head coach Mike Locksley who was his main recruiter; and Ohio State (Haskins’ dream school) made a hard push for him. Former Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer called Haskins the “best” high school quarterback that he had ever seen. He flipped to Ohio State in the weeks before signing day and redshirted in 2016. After backing up J.T. Barrett in 2017, Haskins had a record-setting sophomore season in 2018. He skipped his final two years and entered the 2019 NFL Draft.","Special arm talent…long-levered, but has an efficient load-and-fire release with the ball exploding off his hand…unforced velocity to drive the ball to every inch of the field…throws receivers open with a natural feel for accuracy…large-framed, sturdy passer…sees the entire field and stands tall in the pocket to allow routes to develop…comfortable making high-to-low reads, resetting his eyes on the move…productive on throws 20-plus yards (45.6 percent completions, 14 touchdowns, one interception)…plays poised and confident, showing improved reaction to pressure as the season progressed…at his best in high-pressure situations, completing 71.4 percent of passes with 12.3 yards per attempt, four touchdown passes and zero interceptions in one-score situations in the fourth quarter…not a nimble athlete, but coordinated with his pocket movements…able to fire strikes on the move without sacrificing placement…remarkable production in 2018, becoming only the sixth FBS player to throw for 50 touchdowns in a single-season – his 54 career touchdown passes ranks fourth-best in Ohio State history.","Outstanding fastball, but needs improved touch on layered throws to put the ball between levels of the defense…busy lower body, often throwing with a wide base or flat feet…bad habit of abandoning his base instead of stepping into the rush…pocket presence showed steady improvement, but he is still on the ground level…long, lean lower body, which works against him when attempting to evade pocket pressure…not a graceful scrambler and lacks creative mobility…guilty of staring down targets, forecasting throws to defenders with his big body and eyes…timing as a passer lacks sophistication, dumping it off too quickly or holding the ball too long…doesn’t break tackles and not a powerful finisher like his size suggests (more likely to brace for contact than lower his pads into contact)…only one season of starting experience.","A one-year starter at Ohio State, Haskins was a questionable fit in the Buckeyes’ shotgun, option-heavy offense, but that didn’t slow his production. During his prolific 2018 season, he broke 28 school records and set seven Big Ten records, including single-season passing yards (4,831), touchdown passes (50) and total offensive yards (4,939). Haskins makes playing quarterback look easy because he is so naturally gifted, but his inexperience also shows. While he showed improvements climbing the pocket, maneuvering vs. pressure isn’t yet a strength to his game with inconsistent results throwing off-script. He has a plus arm to grip- and-rip, but he tends to telegraph throws, believing too much in his arm to compensate. His placement and touch have room for improvement, but his passing accuracy is a strength (off-target throws usually tied to messy footwork). Overall, Haskins’ pocket rhythm and lower body mechanics are the biggest concerns for his next level transition, but he showed promising improvement and his special arm has the potential to carve up pro defenses, projecting as an NFL starter with Pro Bowl upside.","1st",15,14,14,373,533,70,4831,50,8,79,108,1.3670886075949367,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,9.625,79.5,5.04,2.9,1.75,28.5,.,.,.,.
"KYLER MURRAY","QB","Oklahoma",1,"8/7/1997","21.73","rJR",70.125,"207","Allen, Texas","Allen","A five-star quarterback recruit out of high school, Kyler Murray, who was born in Bedford, Texas, put together one of the most prolific high school careers in history. As a three-year starter, he led Allen High School to three straight state titles with a perfect 43-0 record as a starter. As a senior in 2014, Murray was responsible for 6,198 yards (4,713 passing, 1,485 rushing) and 79 touchdowns (54 passing, 25 rushing), finishing his prep career with over 14,500 total yards and 186 combined scores. He collected several honors, including Texas and National Player of the Year Award by several publications. Murray was ranked as the No. 1 dual- threat quarterback recruit in the 2015 cycle and narrowed his college choice to Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Texas A&M, choosing the Aggies. His father (Kevin) was a four-year starting quarterback at Texas A&M and finished his career holding most school passing records (chronic ankle injuries kept him from a professional career). Kyler’s uncle (Calvin) was a first-round pick in the 1989 MLB Draft out of Texas and played five seasons in MLB (1999-2004). Kyler Murray spent only one season at Texas A&M before transferring to Oklahoma, sitting out the 2016 season. After spending the 2017 season as Baker Mayfield’s back-up, he had a prolific junior season, winning the Heisman Trophy. Murray was also a standout prep baseball player and was the first player to ever be selected for both the Under Armour All-America Baseball Game and Football Game. He would have been a top pick in the 2015 MLB Draft, but chose to attend Texas A&M, although he transferred before playing baseball for the Aggies. He played 51 games for the Sooners in 2018 and hit .296 with 10 home runs, 13 doubles, 47 RBIs, 46 runs and 10 stolen bases. Murray was drafted No. 9 overall in the 2018 MLB Draft by the Oakland Athletics and signed a contract, including a $4.66 million signing bonus, with the understanding that he would join the A’s following the Sooners 2018 football season. After his Heisman-winning season, Murray elected to forego his remaining college eligibility and play professional football instead of baseball (Murray: “Moving forward, I am firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an NFL quarterback”).","Boasts a whip of an arm with the velocity to deliver lasers…quick release, using various arm angles…naturally accurate, regardless if throwing with a firm base or off-platform…throws a catchable ball and his passes arrive with touch…on-target deep ball, dropping the ball over coverage and in the bucket…dynamic athlete with instant speed…sudden feet in the pocket to elude rushers…patient behind the line of scrimmage with innate instincts to sense pressure, falling back on his athleticism only when necessary…confident competitor and small window throws don’t intimidate him…incredibly productive 2018 season, leading the nation in total yards (school record 5,362), points responsible (342), yards per completion (16.8) and yards per pass attempt (FBS record 11.6).","Undersized – short and lacks ideal bulk on his frame…stares down receivers and needs to be quicker eliminating things mid-read…inefficient progressions disrupt route timing…doesn’t always locate all 11 defenders…ball placement is above-average, but there is room for improvement (throwing to the correct shoulder, away from trouble, etc.)…holds the ball like a briefcase when scrambling and ball security needs improvement…unproven bouncing back from physical hits and durability concerns will always be there due to his size and lack of body armor…needs to prove that he has the maturity for the NFL – suspended the opening drive vs. Baylor (September 2018) for being late to practice…baseball will always be a fallback option for him…only one season of high-level production.","A one-year starter at Oklahoma, Murray had a rough start to his college football career at Texas A&M and all signs pointed to him playing professional baseball, but he put together a special 2018 season for the Sooners. He became the first FBS player to average at least 300 passing yards (311.5) and 60 rushing yards (71.5) per game for a full season, joining Clemson’s Deshaun Watson as the only players to ever record at least 4,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season. In the Sooners zone-read scheme, Murray was primarily in shotgun/pistol and benefited from the best offensive line in college football. There is no question that he is a pass-first quarterback, but his speed creates problems for the defense and he is ideally suited for an offense willing to incorporate a high percentage of sprints, boots and option plays. Regardless if throwing on the move or with an established base, Murray has an organic feel for using ball speeds to put the pass on his target, showing above-average velocity and accuracy. With only one season of production (in a conference with below-average defensive talent), he is still developing mentally with his reads/timing and his lack of size will always be a concern. Overall, Murray, who is incredibly unique with a skill-set unlike anything currently in the NFL, has the arm talent and playmaking instincts that translate to any level, projecting as an NFL starter.","1st",16,14,13,260,377,69,4361,42,7,140,1001,7.15,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,28.5,9.5,69.5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He played varsity hoops as a freshman at Lee’s Summit and later attracted scholarship offers from several prominent basketball programs like Oklahoma, Missouri and Wichita State. Lock became the starting quarterback as a high school sophomore and ascended from a local standout to national recruit. He combined to throw for 5,791 passing yards, 63 touchdowns and 12 interceptions his junior and senior seasons, earning Kansas City All-Metro Player of the Year honors in 2014. Lock was ranked as the top recruit in the state and a top-10 prep quarterback in the country, receiving offers from Ohio State, Tennessee and others. However, he was a legacy at Missouri and chose to stay in state to play for the Tigers. Lock’s father (Andy) was a starting offensive lineman at Missouri (1986-89) where Andy Reid was his offensive line coach (signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent but didn’t make the roster); mother (Laura) has a basketball background; younger sister (Claire) plays collegiate basketball at Missouri-Kansas City; grandfather (Jerry) played football at Missouri (1961-62).","Blessed with a golden arm and easy velocity…football explodes coming out of his hand with a quick, compact release…easily adjusts his arm angles without sacrificing ball speed…coordinated, quick-footed athlete, using his mobility to move the pocket or pick up chunk yards…NFL frame with room to add more bulk…timing/patience to allow routes to develop…trusts his arm talent to make tight-window and “faith” throws…matured football intelligence and hunger for the game…three-year team captain and handles himself with a calm, commanding presence…productive resume and starting experience.","Inconsistent intermediate touch and downfield accuracy…quick to abandon his mechanics and rely on his arm to compensate, leading to erratic placement…cluttered footwork under pressure, often backpedaling to evade…locks onto his preferred target and needs to mature his eye use and vision…too willing to test heavy coverage, making it tough to trust his decision-making…effectiveness plummets when the design of the play breaks down and doesn’t fully use his athleticism to extend plays…small hands and ball security needs to improve when scrambling, as he holds the football away from his body like a dirty diaper (six fumbles in 2018)…owns a 21-25 record (.457) as a collegiate starter, including an 11-20 record (.355) in SEC play and 1-9 record (.100) vs. ranked opponents.","A four-year starter at Missouri, Lock was a natural fit in the Tigers’ shotgun, RPO-style offense with an emphasis on vertical option routes, spending two years (2016-17) under the tutelage of Josh Heupel and one season (2018) with offensive coordinator Derek Dooley. He finished his career second in SEC history in passing yards (12,193) and third in touchdown passes (99). Very similar to Derek Carr coming out of Fresno State, Lock is a classic arm thrower who stubbornly believes that every throw is there, but is still figuring out how to use his eyes and piece together his timing. He showed expanded vision as a senior and appeared to eliminate things quicker mid-read. Overall, Lock showcases a live arm and the makeup required to be an NFL starter, but he needs to continue developing his accuracy, mechanics and decision-making to live up to his intriguing potential.","1st-2nd",37,13,13,275,437,62.9,3498,28,8,55,175,3.1818181818181817,6,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.5,9,77.125,4.69,2.74,1.61,31,112,4.12,7.03,.

He finished with school records in passing yards (6,997) and total touchdowns (98) and earned all-state honors his junior and senior seasons, leading Charlotte Latin to back-to-back Division I state championship games. Jones broke his right (throwing) wrist playing basketball during his junior season, which prevented him from attending any recruiting camps prior to his senior year – he also grew four inches during his junior year in high school. He initially committed to Princeton (his only scholarship offer), but a late push at Duke (his dream school) earned him a grayshirt opportunity – the Blue Devils’ 2015 recruiting class was full, so head coach David Cutcliffe asked him to walk on with the promise of a scholarship once a spot opened (he was awarded a scholarship the following July). After redshirting in 2015, Jones was set to be the backup in 2016 before incumbent starter Thomas Sirk suffered a partial tear of his Achilles in August, thrusting Jones into the role. He has six siblings who played Division I sports, including a younger sister (Ruthie) who recently signed with Duke soccer as one of the top goalkeeper recruits in the country. Jones elected skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft, accepting an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Tall, average-sized frame…quick trigger to read and fire…recognizes coverage assignments and finds the out…has a pre-snap plan…slightly above- average arm strength…understands placement on downfield routes (posts, corners, etc.), setting the school record with 10 career touchdown passes of 50-plus yards…places the ball where his receiver can attack and make a move (holds the Duke career record with a 26.3 completion-to-interception ratio)…not a twitchy athlete, but mobility is an asset (comfortable throwing off platform)…excellent pocket movement, stepping up and keeping his eyes elevated…stronger and tougher than he looks to brush off contact – missed only two games following left shoulder surgery (September 2018)…graduated with a degree in economics (December 2018)…two-time team captain with “impeccable character,” according to Cutcliffe.","Eye manipulation and internal clock are undeveloped…needs to find better balance between not rushing his process, but also playing with urgency…caught staring down routes, leading defenders to the target…still finding his touch as a passer…deep-ball timing is an issue, increasing the difficulty level…lacks elite arm strength to easily add extra RPMs…needs to take better care of the football…mild-mannered personality and still finding his voice as a leader…pedestrian career production with 59.6 percent completions and a 17-19 record as a starter – never earned All-ACC honors.","A three-year starter at Duke, Jones was groomed in the Blue Devils’ spread, no-huddle offense, which incorporated RPO concepts and asked him to use his legs (averaged double-digit carries per game over his 36 starts). A late bloomer, he developed under Cutcliffe’s watchful eye and it is easy to see the Manning influence with his footwork, pocket mannerisms and his release. While he doesn’t have a very impressive resume on paper, Jones elevated the average talent around him on the Duke offense, relying on both his arm and legs. His low-key personality might not immediately win over a room, but he competes with a quiet confidence and doesn’t show any fear on the football field. Overall, Jones doesn’t have any exceptional physical traits and his internal clock requires work, but he is a cerebral passer who makes accurate reads with active eyes and feet, projecting as a B-level NFL starter.","2nd",53,11,11,237,392,60.5,2674,22,9,104,319,3.0673076923076925,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.5,9.75,78.125,4.81,2.83,1.71,33.5,120,4.41,7,.

He finished his career at Davidson with 14,565 yards and a state-record 195 touchdown passes, earning Mr. Football USA in 2013 with 4,989 yards and a national-best 77 touchdowns (also set the national record with 837 yards in a playoff win). Grier was considered the best recruit in the state and a top-five quarterback in the country, committing to Florida over Auburn, North Carolina and Tennessee. After redshirting in 2014, he started five games in 2015 (and went 5-0) before he was suspended for a full-year due to a failed NCAA drug test (October 2015). Grier didn’t want to transfer, but first-year Florida head coach Jim McElwain thought it was best if they parted ways and got a fresh start. He received interest from Ohio State and Oregon as a transfer quarterback, but connected well with Dana Holgorsen and committed to West Virginia, sitting out the 2016 season. Grier was coached in high school by his father (Chad), who played quarterback collegiately at Richmond and East Carolina. Grier’s wife (Jeanne) is a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers cheerleader and they have a 3- year old daughter (Eloise). His two younger brothers (Hayes and Nash) are social media mavens with millions of followers. Grier sat out his bowl game, but accepted an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Balanced steps and delivery…efficient load and fire throwing motion…good enough arm strength and throws a pretty deep ball…puts the ball in a place where his receivers can catch and run…processes things quickly to make snap decisions…nimble athlete and floats well to avoid the rush…smart scrambler and stays composed when the play breaks down…was given freedom to make checks at the line of scrimmage based on pre-snap reads…doesn’t lack for confidence and well- liked by his teammates and coaches at West Virginia…married with a family and more mature than the average prospect due to his life experiences…graduated with his degree in multidisciplinary studies (December 2017)…20-7 career record as a starter…leaves Morgantown No. 2 in school history in touchdown passes (71) and completion percentage (65.7 percent).","Makes reckless decisions as a passer…more comfortable making reads pre-snap rather than post-snap…sloppy base mechanics, throwing on his toes and falling away from his target…lacks zip on throws that have an expiring window…keeps his eyes downfield, but often at the expense of not seeing the rush, even in his direct line of sight…holds the ball too long and takes unnecessary hits…holds the ball nonchalantly away from his body, leading to ball-security concerns…doesn’t have an ideal body type for the NFL…decision-making will be questioned following his year-long PED suspension (October 2015) for taking a banned over-the-counter supplement…older prospect and will be 24 years old on draft weekend.","A two-year starter at West Virginia, Grier was productive in Holgorsen’s version of the air-raid offense, which used up-tempo passing to set up the run. From suspension to transfer to marriage to fatherhood, Grier has experienced much more than most prospects and handled those situations well, giving NFL teams a glimpse of what type of professional he will be. He belongs in gambler’s anonymous with some of his prayers downfield, but he has a confident arm, quick feet and receiver-friendly touch. Overall, Grier struggles to identify/feel pressures and his inconsistent decision-making is a concern, but he is a natural rhythm passer and once he finds that rhythm, he can be deadly, projecting as a backup NFL quarterback worthy of competing for a starting job.","3rd-4th",.,11,11,266,397,67,3864,37,8,48,-90,-1.875,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.5,9.375,75.125,4.84,2.81,1.68,34,112,4.28,7.09,.

He was also a member of Team USA Roller Hockey for 10 years and played tennis and high jumped at Paradise Valley, but he started playing football as a freshman and it quickly became his go-to sport. As a senior, Finley threw for 3,442 yards and 35 touchdowns and earned First Team All-State honors. Rated as a top-10 recruit in Arizona, he received interest from Pac-12 programs, but he committed to Boise State once it offered and stuck to that pledge. After redshirting in 2013 and playing sparingly in 2014, Finley started the first three games of 2015 before a season-ending ankle injury. The following spring, Brett Rypien won the starting job and Finley elected to transfer to NC State over North Texas, primarily because of Eliah Drinkwitz, who was Boise State’s offensive coordinator in 2015 before taking the same post for the Wolfpack in 2016. As a graduate, Finley was eligible immediately in 2016 and was awarded a sixth year of eligibility due to his season-ending injury in 2015.

He finished his career second behind Philip Rivers in several NC State passing categories, including passing yards (10,505). Although his lack of ideal velocity is an issue, Finley delivers a catchable ball with touch and clearly has a firm grasp of the playbook. He is a confident thrower, but his chances are mostly calculated, low-risk passes.

Along with his mother (Rochelle) and older brother (Juder), he moved to Stephenville, Texas at age 9. He developed a close bond with Matt and Katy Copeland (pillars in the Stephenville community), and once he turned 18 years old, Stidham moved in with the Copelands and their three daughters and considers them his family. At Stephenville, Stidham started at wide receiver as a sophomore and caught 11 touchdowns to earn Honorable Mention All-State honors. He took over as the starting quarterback as a junior and earned district MVP honors with 30 touchdown passes in 2013. As a senior, Stidham was named Second Team All-State despite missing two games with a hand injury, finishing with 50 scores (35 passing, 15 rushing). He also earned All- District honors in basketball and ran track in high school. Stidham originally committed to Texas Tech during his junior year in high school, but nine months later he decommitted and days later announced he was headed to Baylor (Art Briles won four state championships as the head coach at Stephenville). He spent most of the 2015 season as the Bears’ backup before starting three games late in the season when Seth Russell was injured. Briles was fired (May 2016) from Baylor amid scandal, and Stidham elected to transfer. For the 2016 season, he enrolled in online courses at Waco’s McLennan Community College and joined the Midway High School program as a scout team quarterback. Considered the No. 1 ranked JUCO recruit, Stidham hoped to stay in Texas (Texas A&M was his preferred destination), but his second recruitment led him to Auburn. After two seasons with the Tigers, he elected to leave school early for the 2019 NFL Draft and accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl. Stidham is engaged to Kennedy Brown, a former Baylor soccer player and the daughter of Houston Rockets CEO Tad Brown.","Well-built frame with room to get stronger…above-average arm strength…able to add RPMs to thread the needle on tight-window throws…his tape is littered with examples of correct placement throws…holds the Auburn record for consecutive pass attempts (162) without an interception…smooth, repeatable throwing mechanics…strong-striding athlete to take the yardage when it is there…outstanding finishing toughness as a runner, lowering his shoulder and driving forward…moves well in the pocket and plays with a sense of control…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (May 2018) and started work on his master’s…named a 2018 team captain, and his leadership skills grew over his time at Auburn.","Doesn’t trust his protection and allows pressure (real or imagined) to affect his decision-making…drops his eyes or eagerly gets rid of the football and would benefit from added patience to allow routes to develop…needs to better anticipate and quicken his trigger…bad habit of leading receivers too far on vertical throws…played in two college offenses that emphasized one-read plays and didn’t ask him to make whole field reads…tendency to run leads to more hits and potential injuries – played through a partially torn left (non-throwing) labrum (September 2017), which required surgery (January 2018) and limited him during spring practice; suffered a broken right ankle (November 2015) in his final game at Baylor, requiring surgery; broke his right hand (October 2014) and required surgery, missing a few games his senior year in high school.","A two-year starter at Auburn, Stidham had a productive yet uneven stint in Gus Malzahn’s spread offense, struggling this past season without Kerryon Johnson to anchor the run game. He appeared to hit his ceiling in Auburn’s elementary-level offense, which stressed tempo and quick reads over breaking down coverages and going through whole-field progressions. Stidham has workable tools with his size, arm talent and athleticism, although his mobility is negated by his frustrating internal clock, either holding the ball too long or rushing the process. His tape didn’t have as many second-chance throws as expected, which was disappointing.

He led the team to the 2014 state championship as a senior and rewrote the school record books, finishing his career ranked top-10 in Michigan history in passing yards (8,028), completions (475) and touchdown passes (85). Ranked as a top-25 recruit in Michigan, Jackson spurned instate offers from Western Michigan and Central Michigan to commit to Buffalo. After the 2018 season, he considered transferring before declaring for the 2019 NFL Draft. As a graduate junior, Jackson accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Tall-framed passer with adequate body thickness…rocket launcher for a right arm with the power in his delivery to zip frozen ropes…effortlessly unleashes his deep ball…small windows don’t intimidate him, trusting his arm strength…throws well on the run with the mobility to efficiently run RPO-style plays or boots…improved downfield touch to drop the ball over the shoulder of his vertical receiver…graduated with his degree in social sciences (December 2018)…set a school record with 35 total touchdowns (28 passing, 7 rushing) in 2018.","Has a hose, but inconsistent direction…accuracy and touch run hot-cold, dropping the ball in the bucket one play and missing an open flat target the next…needs to develop a better feel for his change-up instead of relying on his 100 MPH fastball…straight-legged, heavy mechanics with see-saw shoulders in his delivery…his load-and-fire motion is longer than ideal…stays on his initial read too long and doesn’t anticipate passing windows…late to recognize extra pressures…not a nimble athlete and struggles to evade in the pocket…history of left knee issues (wears a brace), including a dislocated knee cap (November 2014) and a sprain (September 2017) that sidelined him four games as a sophomore.","A three-year starter at Buffalo, Jackson showed steady growth in the Bulls shotgun offense, which incorporated various RPO and spread principles. He was a substantial reason for the program’s improvement from 2-10 (2016) to 6-6 (2017) and 10-4 (2018), becoming the first player in school history to earn the MAC Offensive Player of the Year honors (despite only 55.3 percent completions). If you combined the skill-sets of Cardale Jones and Josh Allen, the result would look something like Jackson, which is both a positive and negative. His elite arm strength helps mask his tardiness, but he needs to speed up his reads and timing at the next level. Overall, Jackson has a power arm with enough impressive throws on tape that will give NFL teams optimism for his future, but there is little consistency with his placement and decision-making, projecting as a developmental project.","5th",.,14,14,225,407,55.3,3131,28,12,55,161,2.9272727272727272,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.25,10.25,83.75,4.59,2.67,1.59,34.5,120,4.28,7.09,.

Thorson was ranked as a top-10 quarterback recruit in the 2014 cycle and committed to Northwestern over Penn State, Boston College and Ole Miss. His father (Chad) was a four-year starting linebacker at Wheaton College (1986-89) and went undrafted, playing in the NFL for the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles and Indianapolis Colts. Thorson married his wife (Audrey) in June 2018. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to an ankle injury.","Well-put-together athlete and passes the eye test…mobility is an important part of his game…above-average arm strength, making opposite hash strikes on a rope…made whole-field progression reads in college…his tape shows examples of him holding the safety with his eyes before hitting the post or slant…accuracy numbers increased on middle-of-the-field throws (crossers, digs, etc.)…four-year starter and became the school’s all-time leading passer (10,731 yards) in his final game…durable and didn’t miss a start over his career, posting a 36-17 record as a starter.","Not an anticipatory thrower…the ball routinely leaves his hand late, allowing defenders to close on the target…doesn’t have a natural feel for accuracy downfield…ball placement needs improvement, often delivering to the wrong shoulder…decision-making needs tightening based on his coverage reads – smart individual, but must process things quicker…mobile athlete, but doesn’t have make-you-miss speed…tore the ACL in his right knee (December 2017) and required surgery; suffered a high ankle sprain in the bowl game (December 2018), which kept him from participating in the Senior Bowl and limited him throughout the pre- draft process.

Green in the first few games). He holds the school records for passing yards (10,731) and passing touchdowns (61). Thorson is a balanced passer with smooth footwork and the arm to unleash impressive throws, but he needs to improve his downfield placement and decision-making to live up to his potential. While he is comfortable “dotting the i” with his fastball, he doesn’t show the same timing or touch on layered throws. Overall, Thorson projects similar to a Jeff Driskel type of NFL prospect: good-sized athlete with a strong arm and intangibles, but inconsistent reads and erratic accuracy project him as more of a journeyman NFL quarterback.","5th-6th",.,14,14,299,489,61.1,3183,17,15,78,-110,-1.4102564102564104,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.125,9.75,76.5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

As a senior, he passed for 3,541 yards and 31 touchdowns to earn All-State honors, graduating with a 4.0 GPA. He committed to Troy over UAB and Akron and technically walked on (January 2015) with the expectation of receiving a scholarship in the summer. Minshew participated in spring drills at Troy, but found himself behind Brandon Silvers and didn’t like the fit, leaving the program and signing with Northwest Mississippi Community College for the 2015 season. After winning the 2015 NJCAA National Title, Minshew transferred to East Carolina where he started seven games over two seasons. He graduated and looked to transfer for his final season, initially committing to Alabama where he was expected to be the third quarterback and get a head start on his coaching career. But Washington State, which was looking for a starting quarterback following the tragic suicide of Tyler Hilinski, made a late pitch and Minshew enrolled in June 2018 (Mike Leach’s pitch: “How’d you like to come and lead the country in passing yards?”). His father (Flint) played football at Millsaps College and his mother (Kim) played basketball at Mississippi State. Minshew accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Natural, quick mechanics from his footwork to his delivery…disciplined eyes, sees the whole field and processes things quickly…accurate within the WSU offense and always aware of his outlets…large hands to grip and get the ball out quickly…calm demeanor and plays with efficient rhythm…comfortable throwing from a confined pocket, but also able to reset and find second-chance throws…engineered three fourth-quarter game-winning drives in 2018…charismatic and his best traits are his “presence” and “leadership qualities,” according to Leach…graduated with his degree in communications (December 2017) at East Carolina…awesome production in 2018, leading the FBS in passing yards per game (367.6) and finishing third in completion percentage (70.7).","Pressure will disrupt his placement and timing…can make all the throws, but doesn’t have a power arm…mechanics tend to break down off platform, throwing off his accuracy…shined in a simplified spread system that emphasized quick reads and shorter routes (ranked 67th in the FBS with 7.22 yards per pass attempt in 2018)…learning a full playbook and verbiage will take time in the NFL…shorter than ideal…only one season as a full-time starter and impressive production.","A one-year starter at Washington State, Minshew thrived in Leach’s air-raid, pass-happy offense, setting school and conference records for passing yards (4,779) and completions (468) in a season. The “one-year wonder” label is unavoidable after his shaky stint at East Carolina and gaudy production in a system known for boosting stats. But Minshew has translatable traits with his passing mechanics, natural accuracy and makeup, bringing out the best in his team with his magnetic, confident personality (NFL scout: “He has some Baker Mayfield to him with his size and energy”). Outside of the WSU offense, had a strong week at the Senior Bowl, showing quick reaction time to read and know where to attack. Overall, there are reasons to doubt him due to his average physical traits and lack of production outside of Leach’s system, but Minshew has the requisite passing skills and competitive mentality to earn an NFL roster spot as a reserve.","6th-7th",.,13,13,468,662,70.7,4779,38,9,58,119,2.0517241379310347,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.75,10.125,74.375,4.97,2.85,1.67,33.5,116,4.45,7.14,.

Rypien finished his prep career with the state records for passing yards (13,044) and pass completions (1,006) and the single-game records for passing yards (613) and completions (44). He was ranked as the No. 10 pro-style quarterback recruit in the 2015 class and the No. 5 recruit in the state. Rypien considered offers from Boise State, Washington and Washington State, becoming the highest-rated commit in Boise State history. His uncle (Mark) played 15 seasons in the NFL and was a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Washington Redskins, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in 1992; his father (Tim) played minor league baseball in the Toronto Blue Jays organization and was Shadle Park’s offensive coordinator in 2014. Rypien accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Steady decision-maker and not married to his initial read…expiring passing windows don’t intimidate him…delivers with touch to every level…smooth release action…confidently sells play fakes…stays poised and light on his feet while working through reads…comfortable sliding in any direction to buy extra half- seconds…tough and bounces back from hits…voted a senior captain with top intelligence and intangibles (high school valedictorian)…elite production, finishing second behind Kellen Moore in almost every passing category…finished his career with 37 wins.","Very average arm strength and often looks like he is throwing a wet ball…inconsistent making anticipatory throws…untidy lower body mechanics, frequently delivering flat-footed…adequate height and hand size, but smaller-framed with little bulk…doesn’t have the escapability to outrun the pass rush…gun-shy tendencies and easily spooked vs. the blitz…needs to speed up his internal clock, taking too many hits, leading to durability concerns – suffered a concussion (September 2017)…ball security needs improvement (25 career fumbles).","A four-year starter at Boise State, Rypien took over the starting quarterback duties as a freshman when Ryan Finley was hurt (September 2015) and didn’t relinquish the role the last four seasons. He finished strong with career bests as a senior and became the Mountain West Conference’s all-time leader in passing yards (13,581), completions (1,036) and 300-yard games (21). Rypien is quick to connect the dots and has the football IQ to break down the defense, but would often write checks that his arm couldn’t cash. Although his improved timing and accuracy as a senior was a welcomed sight, his below-average athleticism continued to limit him. Overall, Rypien does everything fairly well, but nothing extraordinary that would suggest he can pick apart NFL defenses, projecting as a potential backup due to his intelligence and intangibles.","6th-7th",.,13,13,301,447,67.3,3705,30,7,85,12,0.1411764705882353,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.375,9,72.375,4.91,2.86,1.7,33,116,4.29,7.1,.

He was the No. 9 recruit in Nebraska and received scholarship offers from FBS programs Akron and Rutgers, but he committed to FCS powerhouse North Dakota State, sticking to his pledge after Craig Bohl left for Wyoming and Chris Klieman took over as head coach. Filling in for the injured Carson Wentz, Stick went 8-0 as a redshirt freshman before taking over as the full-time starter for his final three years.

He introduced himself to college football as a redshirt freshman when Wentz was injured, going 8-0 in his eight starts in 2015 and finishing as the all-time winningest quarterback in FCS history (49-3 record as a starter). A mobile passer, Stick loved to distribute the wealth in the NDSU offense, but he required well-defined windows and was more likely to use his legs than make full-field reads. He exudes competitive toughness and razor-sharp intelligence with the winning intangibles that NFL coaches will appreciate.

After rushing for nearly 1,300 yards as a sophomore, he rushed for 948 yards and 13 touchdowns in only four games as a junior, missing six games due to a shoulder injury. Jacobs moved from running back to wildcat quarterback as a senior and averaged 15.1 yards per carry in 2015 with 2,704 rushing yards and 31 touchdowns on 179 carries, earning First Team All-State honors. Despite his production, he went underrecruited and didn’t have an FBS offer two months before signing day. However, schools started to take notice in the final weeks, especially when Oklahoma offered the in-state recruit. Alabama offered a week before signing day and Jacobs committed to the Crimson Tide over Missouri. His parents divorced when he was 8 years old and Jacobs moved in with his father (Marty), often sleeping in their car as money was tight (Marty later won custody of Josh and his four siblings). Jacobs has a 3-year old son (Braxton). He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Compact, athletic frame…easy explosion off his plant foot…makes sudden 90-degree cuts without losing speed…changes gaps in a blink at the line of scrimmage with his lateral jump cuts…agile steps in tight spaces…physical finisher and gives as good as he gets when meeting linebackers in the hole…lowers his pads and can be his own blocker…strong lower body, running through ankle tackles…hand-eye coordination and ball skills to make easy adjustments as a pass catcher…was more than just a screen target in college, doing damage on seam and angle routes…only three career fumbles…able to slow down rushers in pass protection…became                                                                                    [13]  the team’s lead blocker in 2018 and bullied defenders…was a key part of multiple special teams coverages with kick return experience, averaging 30.6 yards per return in 2018 with one touchdown (14/428/1)…coaches call him an “intense” practice player and effort is not a concern (Alabama center Ross Pierschbacher: “He does everything right. He is a freak running back”).","Indecisive at times and needs to get north-south quicker…guilty of making too many cuts at times…still developing his feel as an inside runner…didn’t have many home-run plays on his tape (of his 120 carries in 2018, only one went for 20-plus yards)…shared the workload in college and was kept fresh – only three career games with 15-plus offensive touches…battled injuries as a sophomore, including a fractured left ankle (October 2017) and torn left hamstring (November 2017), requiring surgery; didn’t work out at the scouting combine (February 2019) due to a left groin strain.","A three-year backup at Alabama, Jacobs was part of a crowded backfield in Tuscaloosa and fought for snaps behind starter Damien Harris, finishing fourth on the team in rushing yards in 2016, fifth in 2017 and third in 2018. His versatility helped him get on the field as a kick returner, wideout and occasionally as a wildcat quarterback (like he did in high school). Some backs have a strong lower body and others have an explosive lower body, but Jacobs has an explosively strong lower body, allowing him to make violent, start/stop cuts. His lack of touches in college is both a positive (wear and tear not an issue) and a negative (not a proven workhorse). Overall, Jacobs is just scratching the surface of his multi-dimensional skill-set, displaying the explosive and versatile traits to be a three-down feature weapon in the NFL with Pro Bowl upside.","1st-2nd",22,15,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,120,640,5.333333333333333,11,20,247,12.35,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.625,10.125,74.25,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

A knee injury limited him as a senior, but he still tallied 1,474 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns, earning All-State honors. Harris was the No. 1-ranked running back in the 2015 recruiting class and after a brief commitment to Michigan, he strongly considered Ohio State and Kentucky (lived 20 minutes from Lexington) before choosing Alabama. Harris received an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but declined.","Compact build with strong thighs…instinctive and senses openings…NFL-ready vision and decision-making…stays balanced through contact with the pad level and finishing toughness to finish through tackle attempts…squares his shoulders and gets his momentum north-south…flashes an open-field burst with a second gear to outrace pursuit downfield (12 rushes of 30-plus yards the past two seasons)…makes gliding cuts instead of hard stops, preventing him from having to gear down…stops rushers cold in pass pro due to his effort and natural power…only three career fumbles and none the past two years (finished his career with 350 straight touches without a fumble)…durable and looked like the same back regardless of quarter…regular on punt coverages, blocking a punt (September 2017) vs. FSU…hungry competitor…named a 2018 team captain and was an important guy in the locker room…graduated with his degree (December 2018)…consistent production and his 6.45 yards per carry career average ranks third best in SEC history behind Bo Jackson and Derrius Guice.","Not explosive when changing directions…limited juice when attempting to find running room east-west…smaller catch radius, fighting balls that weren’t thrown at his facemask…wasn’t asked to be a workhorse and never had 20-plus carries in a collegiate game…durability wasn’t an issue at Alabama, but he suffered a concussion (November 2018), fought through a nagging right ankle injury (September 2016) as a sophomore and missed four games as a senior in high school due to a MCL sprain in his right knee (October 2014).","A three-year starter at Alabama, Harris took over the starting running back duties after Derrick Henry left for the NFL and led the Crimson Tide in rushing each of the last three years. Although he benefited from a strong offensive line and deep backfield, which allowed him to stay fresh late in games, Harris consistently gained more yards than what was blocked for him due to his vision, competitive edge and ability to shift his weight to elude defenders. He had more pass blocking reps than the average college back and made it his personal mission to bury defenders with his tenacity and awareness. Overall, his lack of initial explosion is his most glaring concern, but his run instincts, balance and versatility make him a not-as-dynamic version of Ezekiel Elliott, projecting as a low-ceiling, high-floor NFL running back.","2nd",55,15,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,150,876,5.84,9,22,204,9.272727272727273,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.75,9.75,72.875,4.57,2.71,1.61,37,121,.,.,16

After earning Third Team All-State honors as a junior, he was named the 2015 Division III Ohio Offensive Player of the Year with 2,707 passing yards, 726 rushing yards and 48 total touchdowns (41 rushing, 7 passing) as a senior. Montgomery wasn’t considered a top-50 recruit in Ohio and went underrecruited, not receiving his first scholarship offer until after his junior season. He performed well at Toledo’s football camp (as a running back) and when Rockets head coach Matt Campbell left Toledo for the same position with Iowa State, he made Montgomery a top priority. Montgomery skipped his senior season to enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Elusive runner due to his balance, low center and run toughness…good-sized athlete and rarely goes down at first contact…flashes strong leg drive and powers through arm tackles when he wants to…patient at the line of scrimmage with strong cuts to keep defenders off balance in the hole…vision to find the cutback lane…easy to appreciate his toughness and nonstop fight…reliable ball skills with focus to stab away from his body…steady base and awareness in pass protection to face-up and keep rushers occupied…only three career fumbles on 695 touches (and never more than one in a season)…named a 2018 team captain and his coaches call him a “culture changer” due to his work ethic, effort and character (Eagle Scout who is very involved in his community)…ranked sixth in school history in career rushing yards (2,925) and all-purpose yards (3,507).","Lacks instant acceleration to speed away from pursuit…wasn’t a big-play creator in college (2018: zero rushes of 40-plus yards and only two rushes of 30-plus yards)…too much east-west and guilty of making too many moves…late to read and anticipate developing lanes…bad habit of bracing for contact in the hole instead of lowering his pads…not a hammer and doesn’t always fall forward…always carries the ball in his left hand…awareness as a route-runner must improve…missed one game as a junior due to an upper arm injury (October 2018).","A three-year starter at Iowa State, Montgomery was an every-down back in the Cyclones shotgun, zone-read offense, often flanked to the left/right of the quarterback. He benefited from inferior tackling in the Big 12, but he runs with the active feet and ultra-competitive urgency that allows him to break tackles. While elusive in short areas, Montgomery is quicker than fast with inconsistent anticipation (more of a checkers runner, not chess). He has off-the-chart intangibles with the receiving and blocking potential to fit multiple roles. Overall, Montgomery doesn’t have much “special” to him as an athlete and he needs to see things quicker, but he doesn’t concede easily and has the run balance/toughness to be productive.","3rd",75,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,257,1216,4.7315175097276265,13,22,157,7.136363636363637,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.375,9.25,77.375,4.63,2.7,1.61,28.5,121,.,.,15

After eclipsing 1,000 rushing yards in both his sophomore and junior seasons, he was named Mr. Football in Pennsylvania (AAA/AAAA level) as a senior with 1,523 rushing yards (11.2 average) and 16 touchdowns, finishing his prep career with 4,573 rushing yards (9.0 average). Sanders was the consensus No. 1 running back recruit in the country and the top recruit in the state. He became the top priority of newly hired head coach James Franklin and verbally committed to the Nittany Lions the summer prior to his junior season in high school, staying true to that pledge. Sanders elected to skip his final season and entered the 2019 NFL Draft.","Looks the part with proportionate build…calculating runner, patiently reading blocks and hitting holes…lower body strength, controlled lateral cuts and natural balance allow him to squirm out of tackle attempts (3.5 yards after initial contact in 2018)…understands pacing, making tackles a chore for defenders…doesn’t seek out contact, but it doesn’t bother him either…uses his peripherals to find the cutback lane…natural receiving traits, adjusting his frame with soft hands to catch and go…wasn’t worn down by excessive touches in college…averaged 108.7 yards of total offense (fourth best in the Big Ten) in his lone season as a starter.","His cuts have bounce, but not organic explosion…relies more on timing-pacing than burst to shake defenders…prefers to sidestep contact rather than power through it…runs tough, but more finesse than expected…late to get north-south on outside runs…ball security was an issue with nine fumbles on only 308 offensive touches (fumbled once every 34.2 touches)…offers blocking upside, but needs to improve his awareness and urgency in pass protection…only one season as the full-time back.","A one-year starter at Penn State, Sanders patiently waited his turn behind Saquon Barkley for two seasons before taking over as the starter in the Nittany Lions’ RPO-heavy scheme. He finished second in the Big Ten (behind Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor) with 1,274 rushing yards in 2018, which was 3j more yards than Barkley’s 1,271 total in 2017. Although he isn’t naturally explosive and not as likely to juke NFL defenders, Sanders is able to create yardage for himself with his reactive run style. He is a reliable pass catcher, but must become more dependable as a blocker and cut down on the fumbles for an NFL play-caller to trust him. Overall, Sanders isn’t a sudden athlete or hammer inside, but his combination of awareness, balance and pacing allows him to instinctively sort through the trash, slip tackle attempts and find creases.","3rd",76,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,220,1274,5.790909090909091,9,24,139,5.791666666666667,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.625,9.25,74.625,4.49,2.61,1.57,36,124,4.19,6.89,20

Despite his gaudy production, Singletary wasn’t considered a top-100 running back recruit in the 2016 class. He initially committed to Illinois before flipping to Florida Atlantic on signing day.

Singletary runs with remarkable balance to elude in tight quarters, leading the FBS with 69.8 percent of his rushing yards in 2018 coming after initial contact. He is tougher than he looks, but his lack of body armor and questions about being a three-down player will be the main concerns for his next-level transition.

After leading South Panola to a state title in 2012 (over Gardner Minshew’s Brandon High School), he rushed for 2,024 yards as a junior in 2013. As a senior, Henderson led the team to a perfect 15-0 record, including the 6A state championship where his final high school carry was the game-winning touchdown. He was named Mississippi’s 2014 Gatorade Football Player of the Year with 2,253 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns as a senior, finishing his prep career with 5,801 rushing yards (school record). Despite his high school production, Henderson wasn’t considered a top-30 recruit in the state and went overlooked by nearby SEC programs Mississippi State and Ole Miss. He committed to Memphis over Middle Tennessee State in the 2015 recruiting cycle, but academic issues kept him from enrolling until January 2016. Henderson skipped his senior season and entered the 2019 NFL Draft (also skipped the bowl game).","Built low to the ground to maintain his balance at contact…shifts gears to skillfully weave through the defense, destroying pursuit angles…owns a dynamic plant-burst-accelerate sequence through the hole…able to laterally juke from trouble…good feel for inside-outside zone, making quick reads…instinctively strings moves together and gravitates toward space…at his best off tackle, using a runway to turn on the jets…big-play threat, leading the FBS in plays of 40-plus yards (15) and 50-plus yards (12) in 2018…his 8.23 yards per carry in his career is No. 1 in FBS history (minimum 415 carries)…has kick return experience with one career return touchdown (25/487/1)…reliable finishing when targeted and nifty after the catch.","Undersized build with limited growth potential…average run power…needs to better lower his pads to create momentum through contact…swerves around corners instead of putting his foot in the ground and making sharp 90-degree turns…better initial acceleration than long speed…indecisive at times in the backfield…most of his broken tackles came outside the tackles…active in the screen game, but didn’t run diverse routes…room to improve his ball security (four fumbles the last two seasons)…wasn’t asked to pass protect on a regular basis.","A three-year starter at Memphis, Henderson was the lead back in the Tigers’ run-oriented zone scheme, benefiting from a rotation that helped keep him fresh and sizable holes on tape. He leaves Memphis No. 2 in most rushing categories (behind DeAngelo Williams), including career rushing yards (3,545) and rushing scores (36). Similar to Dalvin Cook, Henderson is at his best when he can slash and weave through gaps, using his open-field moves to make defenders look silly at the second level. He isn’t much of a grinder inside and likely won’t be the same type of home-run hitter at the next level due to average long speed. Overall, Henderson faces a significant jump in difficulty level going from AAC defenses to the NFL, but his combination of balance, agility and run instincts helps him gravitate toward space, projecting best in a zone-heavy scheme.","3rd",80,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,214,1909,8.92056074766355,22,19,295,15.526315789473685,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,31,8.625,73.875,4.51,2.48,1.56,33.5,121,.,.,22

After rushing for 1,426 yards as a junior, he posted 1,948 rushing and 32 touchdowns, surpassing 100 yards in every game and earning Offensive Player of the Year honors for his level. Hill ranked as a top-10 recruit in Oklahoma, but he ended his recruitment shortly after it began, committing to Oklahoma State (his first offer) during his junior year. His younger brother (Daxton) was a five-star safety recruit in the 2019 class, committing to Michigan over Alabama, Clemson and dozens of others. Hill elected to skip his senior season (and the bowl game) and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Outstanding short-area burst to laterally plant and juke…springy lower body and makes tackle attempts more difficult…quickly collects his feet to redirect and accelerate through holes…runs with a natural feel and timing for cutback lanes, sensing holes before they expand…shows the initial speed to out- leverage the defender on the perimeter…uses a stiff-arm to extend outside runs…competitive with the ball in his hands and doesn’t waste time dancing…decent receiving production in college (49/304/1)…five career fumbles, but none in 2018…one of only six players in school history to reach 3,500 career rushing yards.","Lean-muscled body type and lacks ideal body armor…runs with tall pads, preferring to turn his shoulder into contact…doesn’t offer the run power to shake off tackle attempts…feet lose life quickly at contact…impatient ball carrier, attacking lanes before they develop and making too much contact with his own blockers…fearless picking up the blitz, but looks more like a speed bump due to poor anchor-technique…missed most of the Bedlam Game with a rib injury (November 2018), sitting out the next two contests.","A three-year starter at Oklahoma State, Hill quickly made an impact in Stillwater and led the Cowboys in rushing each of his three seasons. After leading the Big 12 in rushing (by a sizable margin) as a sophomore, he shared more of the workload as a junior (three OSU players had 120-plus carries), finishing just shy of 1,000 yards. Hill is a fun ball carrier to study because he is a chunk play waiting to happen with his lateral agility and quick-thinking rush attack (41 plays of 20-plus yards in college). However, he runs slanted and tends to be overly impulsive, sensing run lanes, but inconsistent timing hurts his batting average. Overall, Hill has questionable three-down ability in the NFL, but he is a shifty, balanced runner who is tough to tackle one-on-one, projecting as a complementary weapon.","3rd-4th",95,10,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,158,930,5.886075949367089,9,13,68,5.230769230769231,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.625,9.5,74.875,4.4,2.6,1.56,40,130,.,.,21

Williams looks his best downhill where he can attack lanes and allow his athleticism to take over. He is still in the development phase as a pass catcher and blocker, but shows noticeable upside in both areas.

Combining for 2,753 rushing yards his final two prep seasons, he posted 1,456 rushing yards as a senior with 23 touchdowns, earning 2013 Conference Offensive Player of the Year honors. Moore didn’t make much of a dent on the recruiting radar with only FCS-level offers (Gardner-Webb, Wofford, Southern) until Appalachian State, which was in the process of making the FCS-to-FBS transition at the time, had a spot open a week before signing day. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to his ankle injury.","Muscular, athletic frame…runs with a low center and powerful lower body (squats 650 pounds), making it a chore for defenders to finish him…sharp, balanced cuts to shift well between open space…forces defenders to overpursue with slight movement…shows a burst to beat defenders to the corner…lowers his pads and finishes forward to grind through arm tackles…terrific ball security with only two fumbles on 605 career offensive touches…reliable in pass pro…genuinely loves to push himself, especially in the weight room…no one will question his toughness…productive career resume, averaging 6.1 yards per carry.","Maxed out build and lacks ideal bulk for the position…has some tightness in his swivel…needs to add more patience to his run diet and allow blockers to do their job…too reactive and needs to show better anticipation at the line of scrimmage…below average pass-catching production…medical evaluations will be important after missing most of his senior season with a broken right ankle (October 2018), requiring surgery; also missed chunks of the 2017 season with various injuries and an illness.","A three-year starter at Appalachian State, Moore was the understudy to Marcus Cox (school’s all-time leading rusher) before bursting out of his shadow in 2016 when Cox was injured, earning Conference Offensive Player of the Year honors.

Moore is an agile-footed ball carrier with terrific run balance and the lower body that continues to grind yards. Although he would benefit from improved patience and pace, he is a tough-minded finisher and the type of competitor who doesn’t accept limitations. Overall, Moore needs to stay on the field because he is a relentless, talented runner with three-down potential capable of carving out a significant NFL role.","4th",.,5,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,63,400,6.349206349206349,6,6,40,6.666666666666667,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.375,9.5,77.875,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,27

He rushed for 1,488 yards and 18 touchdowns as a senior, including the single-game rushing record (337). Armstead committed to Temple prior to his senior year and stuck to his pledge over offers from Virginia and Old Dominion. His younger sister (Rachell) is a hurdler on the Temple track and field team. Armstead accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Classic north-south runner who quickly gets downhill…urgent runner and attacks the line of scrimmage…runs behind his pads and relies on forward momentum and leg drive to pick up positive yards…footwork to make hard stops and cut away from trouble…active in pass protection…highly competitive with or without the ball in his hands (former Temple head coach Geoff Collins: “He is one of the most competitive kids I have ever been around.”)…four career fumbles, but only one in 2018…finished his career fourth all-time in rushing (2,812 yards) at Temple.","Runs square and lacks the hip or lower body flexibility to contort his frame…not elusive and won’t routinely make defenders miss…choppy footwork and tackles himself at times…lacks a home-run gear…second-level vision is lacking…holds the ball too loose from his body…inconsistent focus and adjustment skills as a pass catcher…battled various minor injuries the past two seasons, including a sprained left ankle (October 2018) that sidelined him for several games.","A two-year starter at Temple, Armstead had a disappointing junior season, but bounced back strong as the senior starter, averaging 109.8 rushing yards per game, which ranked 16th best in the FBS. He also set an AAC single-game record with six rushing touchdowns vs. Houston (November 2018). Armstead isn’t much of a big-play threat due to his stiff hips, but he doesn’t waste time attacking run lanes and weaving through the defense. Once he gets the ball, he is like a runaway dump truck with the brake line cut, preferring to go through defenders. Overall, Armstead is a developmental third-down back with the competitive profile to grind out tough yards and hold up in pass protection – he will be drafted higher if he catches the ball well during pre-draft workouts.","4th",.,10,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,210,1098,5.228571428571429,13,8,52,6.5,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.625,9.125,72.75,4.45,2.61,1.57,30,114,4.29,7.02,22

He was also the 2014 4x100 state champion and had offers to run track collegiately. Love chose to focus exclusively on football and considered offers from several local schools, including North Carolina, NC State, East Carolina, Virginia Tech and Tennessee, but he ultimately committed to Stanford (4.5 GPA in high school). His father (Christopher) played football and ran track at South Carolina; his brother (Chris) was a wide receiver at East Carolina; his uncle (Reggie) played football at North Carolina. Love initially accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl before pulling out due to injury.","Lightning quick feet to stop and redirect his momentum in a fluid motion…instant accelerator once he has an opening, using his speed to eliminate pursuit angles…his wheels at the second level are the last thing safeties want to see with his ability to set up open-field moves and take it the distance (set the FBS- record with 13 runs of 50-plus yards in 2017)…low center of gravity and maintains his speed at contact to keep his feet through tackle attempts…trusts the play design and shows patience to allow his blockers to do the dirty work…adequate ball security (four career fumbles)…looks like Mighty Mouse in pass protection, showing patience, technique and courage to body and slow down rushers…highly intelligent with strong commitment to education…graduated with his degree in human biology and plans to become a pediatrician after football (was his goal since he was a child and a doctor cured his pneumonia)…remarkable 2017 season, finishing second in the Heisman Trophy voting and breaking Christian McCaffrey’s Stanford records for rushing yards in a game (301) and in a season (2,118).

He returned for his senior year to finish his degree, but his production plummeted as he battled through injuries, including an ACL tear on the final play of his college career. While he benefited from a strong offensive line in college, Love deserves credit for his patience, burst and trust in the play design to maximize those opportunities. He runs low to the ground with better-than-expected strength and warrior toughness, but his durability will always be a concern due to his smaller frame. Overall, Love’s vision, speed and run anticipation are a deadly combination, projecting best as a complementary weapon and shared role in an NFL backfield.","4th-5th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,166,739,4.451807228915663,6,20,99,4.95,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,29.375,9.125,72.875,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,18

After seeing time at receiver as a sophomore, he rushed for nearly 2,000 yards and 34 touchdowns as a junior. Anderson had his best season as a senior with 2,485 rushing yards (9.9 average) and 36 touchdowns, leading Katy to the 6A Division II State Championship Game. He finished his prep career with 5,493 rushing yards (9.1 average) and was considered a top-20 recruit in Texas. Anderson initially verballed to Texas A&M early in the process before decommitting and signing with Oklahoma. Anderson’s uncle (Mark) was a fifth-round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft out of Alabama and played in the NFL for seven seasons, including two Super Bowl appearances (Rodney made the trip for both). Anderson suffered two season-ending injuries his first two seasons on campus and started the 2017 season as the backup before taking over the starting role for the final seven games. He suffered another season-ending injury in 2018 and elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Well-built, big-boned frame…physical body type to match violence at contact…controls his feet well for a bigger back…shows a strong pivot off his plant foot to make sharp, efficient cuts…resets his vision quickly to locate developing lanes and adjust his path…reads his blockers and allows them to do the dirty work…runs hungry and finishes through contact…doesn’t put the ball on the ground (zero fumbles in college)…steady hands as a receiver…graduated with his degree in arts and sciences (May 2018)…carries himself with a goal-oriented mindset and owns the mental toughness and work ethic required to be a professional.","Runs tall with inconsistent pad level…one-speed ball carrier and doesn’t have explosive traits…lacks the shiftiness to routinely make defenders whiff in space…would benefit from added patience while reading his blocks…runs tough, but not powerful at the line of scrimmage…inconsistent results in pass protection due to break down and strength issues…durability is a bright red flag, suffering season-ending injuries by mid-September three out of the last four years; broke his left leg on special teams coverage (September 2015); an MRI revealed a broken bone in his neck after a freak play during practice (August 2016); injured his right knee (September 2018) and required surgery.","A one-year starter at Oklahoma, Anderson emerged midway through the 2017 season as one of the best backs in college football, rushing for 1,079 yards in the final eight games, including 201 rushing yards in the loss to Georgia in the Rose Bowl. Unfortunately for Anderson, he missed almost all of the 2018 campaign, similar to his first two years on campus, making durability and reliability the main concerns in his evaluation. Anderson runs reminiscent of a not-as-explosive version of James Conner due to his NFL size and ability to read blocks, gashing defenses with his competitive run style. He isn’t as effective in pass protection as his size might suggest, but he should contribute early as a pass catcher. Overall, Anderson is more efficient than explosive, but he is a quick-minded runner who anticipates, reads and controls his feet to set up moves, projecting as an NFL starter if he stays healthy.","4th-5th",.,2,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,11,119,10.818181818181818,3,0,0,.,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.75,9.75,75.375,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,25

Mattison earned All-Conference honors in wrestling, winning the 195-pound title, and also won the league title in the 110-meter hurdles in track, finishing fourth in the 100 meters and long jump. He was the No. 44 running back in the 2016 recruiting class and held offers from Pac-12 programs like Arizona State and Washington, but he signed with Boise State, becoming the first San Bernardino football player to sign with a Division I program since 2009.

Mattison runs with the vision and patience to allow blocks to develop, using slight movements in the hole to pick up yards after contact. Although his burst and twitch are ordinary and will be magnified vs. NFL speed, his finishing determination is a productive asset. Overall, Mattison isn’t overly dynamic, but his junior tape showed a crafty runner and pass catcher who maximized his opportunities, projecting as a steady backup option in the NFL.","5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,302,1415,4.685430463576159,17,27,173,6.407407407407407,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,31,9.125,76.25,4.67,2.71,1.61,35,127,4.29,7.13,22

Thompson was ranked as a top-20 recruit in the state out of high school, but didn’t have the grades and enrolled at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M where he was teammates with Texas A&M tight end Jace Sternberger during the 2017 season. After redshirting in 2015, he played two seasons at the JUCO level and earned SWJCFC Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2017 with 1,391 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. A three-star JUCO recruit, Thompson committed to Utah State over offers from Southern Miss, Troy and others. His uncle (David) was a running back at Oklahoma State and in the NFL (1997-99). Thompson declared for the 2019 NFL Draft after one season with the Aggies.","Rocked-up muscle definition with under 5 percent body fat on his frame…dynamic start-stop athleticism to dart away from pursuit…goes zero-to-60 in a blink to obliterate pursuit lines…maintains his balance in/out of his cuts…uses tilt and run angles to manipulate space…soft hands as a pass catcher…does some of his best work in the screen game with his vision and burst…only one fumble in 2018…led the MWC in yards per rush (6.82), which ranked 13th best in the FBS.","Small-framed athlete with near maxed out bulk…minimal power as an inside runner and doesn’t have the body type to pick up tough yards…tends to run unpredictable – some runs look more determined than others…technical lapses in pass protection and doesn’t have a high ceiling in this area…wasn’t asked to be a workhorse with only one game of 20-plus touches in 2018…didn’t play on special teams at Utah State.","A one-year starter at Utah State, Thompson shared the running back duties with Gerold Bright in 2018, but Thompson’s role grew throughout the season, starting the final nine games. He led the team in rushing and became the 32nd player in school history to rush for 1,000-plus yards. Hovering around the 200-pound range, Thompson is a small package player and won’t overpower defenders as a runner, but he has outstanding balance and jitterbug quickness, giving him a chance to squirt through contact. How he does fielding punts during pre-draft workouts could be a key to his final draft grade. Overall, Thompson is a Tarik Cohen-type of prospect: undersized with minimal power, but his start-stop athleticism and instant juice make him a dangerous player in a complementary role.","5th",.,13,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,153,1044,6.823529411764706,14,23,351,15.26086956521739,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He also ran track and won the 2015 3A state title in the 100 meters (11.02), taking second in the 4x100. Gaskin was considered a top-10 recruit in the state and committed to the Huskies early in the process, choosing Washington over Arizona State.

While he benefited from a strong offensive line, Gaskin shows a natural feel with the ball in his hands to pick through the defense. He is a competitive runner and solid pass catcher, but he isn’t powerful and will struggle to block NFL rushers.

Weber set the state single-game rushing record (404 yards) and finished the 2014 season as a First Team All-State honoree. He was the No. 7 running back in the 2015 recruiting cycle and No. 2 player in the state of Michigan. Weber initially committed to Michigan (his favorite school growing up), but decommitted when Brady Hoke was fired, signing with Ohio State on signing day. With Ezekiel Elliott entrenched as the starter, he redshirted in 2015 and became the starter in 2016, sharing the running back duties with J.K. Dobbins his final two seasons. Weber chose to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Accelerates well through the hole…has the speed to outpace pursuit downfield…finds his blocks and trusts his vision…runs balanced and tough, making it tough for angled tackle attempts to ground him…efficient spin move, staying on his feet…quick hands to spear catches away from his body…steps up in pass protection, staying low and sticking his shoulder in the gut of rushers to slow them down.","Average frame and build for NFL work…doesn’t offer a burst once handed the ball…slow to set up his moves, both at the line of scrimmage and second level…ordinary wiggle and not a dynamic make-you-miss threat…minimal run power and lacks the body strength to consistently force his way through gaps…fumbled 10 times over three seasons, include four times in 2018…only two starts the last two seasons and was part of a running back timeshare…played through a torn left hamstring the first half of 2017, avoiding surgery.","A one-year starter at Ohio State, Weber became the third Ohio State freshman to rush for 1,000-plus yards in 2016 and shared the running back duties with Dobbins the last two seasons. It was the first time in Buckeyes history that two running back teammates each had 2,000-plus career rushing yards. Weber carries the ball with terrific balance, but he runs with better quicks than explosive traits, which limits his elusiveness. He has adequate skills as a blocker and pass catcher, which boosts his chances of sticking on a roster.

Over his final two years of high school, he combined for 3,903 rushing yards and 57 total touchdowns, earning several Player of the Year honors. Snell was ranked just outside the top-50 running back recruits in the country and most of the bigger programs, including nearby Ohio State (which asked him about playing linebacker), overlooked him. Kentucky showed early interest and out-recruited his other suitors (Cincinnati, Iowa, Bowling Green), signing him after his junior year. Snell’s father (Benjamin) played running back at Ohio Northern before a professional playing career with the Baltimore Ravens, NFL Europe and XFL; Snell’s great-uncle (Matt) had an accomplished career at Ohio State and was a fourth-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft (Super Bowl III is best remembered for Joe Namath’s guarantee, but Snell rushed for 121 yards and the Jets’ only touchdown in that legendary game). Snell elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Prototypical size for the position…balanced at contact and keeps his feet underneath him…lowers his pads and grinds his legs to consistently pick up yards after contact (935 yards after initial contact ranked sixth best in the FBS in 2018)…sees the field well, using patience and anticipation to feel openings…runs with attitude and determination to maximize each run…stays busy in pass protection, showing the alertness and toughness required…high-stamina runner, playing the same in the fourth quarter as he did in the first…durable and reliable (six fumbles on 766 career touches)…verbose, energetic personality and voted a 2018 team captain…holds over a dozen school records, including career rushing yards (3,873) and 100-yard rushing games (19).","Average explosive traits…runs with urgency, but not burst…lacks ideal long-speed to routinely accelerate from pursuit…inconsistent feel on outside runs…loses a shade of momentum in his cuts…improved receiving production each season, but was primarily a dump-off option…fumbled twice each of his three collegiate seasons.","A two-year starter at Kentucky, Snell was the workhorse of the Wildcats’ offense and a substantial reason for the program’s 10-win season in 2018, the first double-digit win season for Kentucky since 1977. He is the first player in school history with three straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons and joined Herschel Walker as the only players in SEC history to rush for at least 1,000 yards and 12 touchdowns in their first three seasons. Regardless of scoreboard or situation, Snell is highly competitive and runs with a chip on his shoulder. With his balance and vision, he has a natural feel to work his way through holes, but he isn’t an elusive back who will easily shake defenders. Overall, Snell isn’t as dynamic as other backs in this draft class and he would have been drafted much higher in the 1995 version of the NFL, but the league still values reliable runners who can take abuse and continue to produce.","5th-6th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,289,1449,5.013840830449827,16,17,105,6.176470588235294,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,31,9.375,74.25,4.66,2.73,1.65,29.5,119,4.33,7.07,16

He split his practice time between the backs and receivers and even saw action at safety during his redshirt year. Pollard elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Fluid athlete with multiple gears…average long-speed, but his instant juice will bemuse defenders…efficient catch-to-run movements…displays the vision and lateral quicks to weave through enemy territory…attacks the ball away from his body…impact kick returner in college with seven return touchdowns, averaging 29.4 yards per return (89/2,616/7)… played on punt coverages with 13 career tackles (blocked a punt in 2016)…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…experienced at receiver and running back…battled food poisoning at the Combine, which explains the improved numbers at his on-campus pro day.","Tweener body type…inconsistent results when asked to adjust and finish away from his frame…wasn’t asked to run anything resembling a diverse route tree…bad habit of hopping as he enters his routes…unproven as a vertical threat…doesn’t have the body strength to power through tackle attempts…indecisive inside runner, struggling to find a healthy balance between patience and conviction…always searching for the home run instead of lowering his pads and taking what is there…marginal success as a blocker due to pillow hands, not creating push or sustaining…didn’t return punts at Memphis.","A three-year starter at Memphis, Pollard split his time between the backfield and the slot with most of his touches coming on wide receiver screens and swing passes, getting him in motion to catch and run. His greatest impact at the college level came as a kick returner with seven return touchdowns (including three 100-plus yard returns), matching the NCAA record. A playmaking athlete, Pollard was more of an extension of the run game than downfield threat in the Tigers’ offense and requires development at both running back and receiver. While he is experienced at various positions, there is a difference between being versatile and lacking a defined role and he seems to be more of the latter. Overall, Pollard is a jack of all trades but master of none type of weapon and it will take commitment from an offensive play-caller for Pollard to carve out a meaningful role in an NFL offense.","6th",.,14,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,78,552,7.076923076923077,6,49,458,9.346938775510203,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,30,9.5,73.75,4.52,2.63,1.58,35,121,.,.,13

Ozigbo was ranked as a top-60 running back recruit in the 2015 class, initially committing to Iowa State over Iowa, Boise State and a few others, but flipped to Nebraska once they offered late in the process.

He finished second in the Big 12 with 12 rushing scores and was one of only 11 players nationally to average 7.0-plus yards per carry. Ozigbo is a straight-line athlete and lacks an elusive lower body, but he makes quick decisions to swerve away from danger. His toughness in pass protection and experience as a receiver will be traits that separate him from other college backs.

Barnes posted 2,361 rushing yards and 38 touchdowns as a senior and finished his career with 4,835 rushing yards and 83 touchdowns, setting the league records for rushing yards in a season and career. He was the No. 71 running back nationally and the No. 7 recruit in Kansas, committing to Kansas State over Kansas, Minnesota and Rutgers.

He led the Big 12 in rushing in 2018, finishing his career second in school history in yards per carry (5.71) and fourth in rushing yards (2,616). Barnes is built for the physicality of the position and is a surprisingly nimble player for his size. He flashes short-area burst and outstanding lower body leg drive, but he doesn’t show the elusive traits to routinely make defenders miss.

He set a personal-best in the 100 meters (11.50) in track and rushed for 1,315 yards and scored 13 touchdowns as a senior, finishing his prep career with 3,200 rushing yards and 50 total scores. Homer was the No. 10 running back recruit nationally in the 2016 class and committed to Miami (Fla.) over Alabama, Florida and Florida State, becoming Oxbridge’s first Power Five conference signee. His older brother (Tevin) was a defensive back at Florida Atlantic and went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, spending time in the Washington Redskins camp. Homer elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Makes sharp, coordinated cuts to catch defenders napping…instinctive run qualities to press, sort and burst…allows alleys to develop with a natural feel for angles…runs tougher than he looks, lowering his pads and driving his legs to finish…offers speed to the edge and accelerates to his top gear quickly (five rushes of 40-plus yards in 2018)…active in the screen game, showing soft hands…if you ask him what he does best on the football field, he will tell you pass protect, showing steady technique as a blocker…team captain in 2018...averaged over 6.0 yards per carry in his career.","Lean muscled frame and lacks ideal body mass…overly patient at times and guilty of indecision in the backfield…limited inside power and doesn’t have the run strength to move the pile…lacks wiggle in space and more likely to run over defenders than shake them…ball security is a red flag with six career fumbles, including four in 2018…durable in college but averaged only 14.0 touches per game as a starter and wasn’t asked to be a workhorse.","A two-year starter at Miami (Fla.), Homer was elevated to starter in early 2017 when Mark Walton was injured, falling just shy of 1,000 yards each of the last two seasons. He finished short of 2,000 career rushing yards, but passed Frank Gore (1,975) into 12th place on the school’s all-time career rushing list. Homer is wired a little differently and doesn’t follow or watch football (NFL or college), but he is all business on the field. He anticipates run lanes before they expand and shows the instincts to zig when other runners would zag. Overall, Homer is a nifty upfield runner with his feel and plant-and-go cutting skills, but it is his versatility as a pass catcher, blocker and special teamer that will make him attractive to NFL teams, fitting best in a third-down role.","6th-7th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,164,985,6.0060975609756095,4,19,186,9.789473684210526,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.5,10,75.5,4.48,2.61,1.57,39.5,130,4.31,7.07,17

Higdon totaled 1,471 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns over his prep career and was considered a top-40 running back recruit. Higdon initially committed to Iowa (over Arkansas, Duke and Tennessee), but flipped to Michigan on signing day, citing UM’s medical school as the reason. He has a close relationship with his mother (Samantha Christian), who moved to Ann Arbor to give him a support system away from home. Higdon has a 4-year old daughter (Kiyah), who is his “motivation” and “reason I do what I do.” He is the founder of a non-profit organization called “Empire for the Youth.”","Runs confident and physical between the tackles…displays natural balance to run through below-the-waist and arm tackle attempts…looks to finish each run, routinely falling forward…quick through holes and transitions his momentum well mid-cut…run instincts allow him to follow blocks and time his moves…nice job giving up his body in pass protection, cutting down blitzers…works hard in the weight room and pays attention to conditioning…voted a 2018 team captain and coaches speak highly of his character (Michigan HC Jim Harbaugh: “Karan’s got a great track record of being a ‘do stuff right’ guy”)…wasn’t worn down in college…became first in his family to graduate (May 2018) from a four-year college and is a certified registered nurse anesthetist.","Runs tough but doesn’t have ideal run strength to consistently break tackles as an inside runner…not an elusive start-stop athlete…only ordinary size for the position and appears maxed out physically…limited track record as a pass catcher (16 career catches)…only three career fumbles, but he holds the ball loose and ball security needs to improve…missed one game as a senior due to a sprained ankle (September 2018)…underwent bilateral groin surgery (March 2019).","A two-year starter at Michigan, Higdon took over the starting duties as a junior and grew into the workhorse of the Wolverines run game as a senior in 2018 (in his 13 career 100-yard rushing games, Michigan has a perfect 13-0 record).

The biggest difference between his junior and senior tape was his improved decision-making, showing toughness on each carry to maximize runs.

He was the starting running back as a sophomore and emerged as one of the best players in Georgia as a junior, posting 1,735 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns. He battled an ankle injury as a senior but still finished with 1,069 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns to earn First Team All-State honors. Holyfield was the No. 6 running back in the 2016 recruiting class and strongly considered Auburn, Notre Dame and Ohio State before deciding to stay home and play for Georgia. His father (Evander) is a former four-time world heavyweight champion boxer, also competing in the 1984 Olympics. Elijah’s parents split up when he was only 1 year old, and he grew up with his mother (Tamie Pettaway) and stepfather (Chris), although Evander has been a close part of his life. Holyfield elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Owns an NFL body with his brawny, muscular build…drops his pads and attacks with leg drive and a heavy shoulder…punishes tacklers with his low, physical run style…takes a beating and pops up before the defender…balanced at contact and spins off tackle attempts…not a dancer and quickly gets north- south…lateral quickness to juke and transition away from trouble, finding his top speed quickly…only one fumble in college (and didn’t record a fumble in high school)…team captain…committed to his craft and coaches praise his maturity and makeup (Georgia head coach Kirby Smart: “His work ethic day in and day out, his toughness and his attitude, is tremendous”).","Sporadically picks his spots and needs to be a better decision-maker at the line of scrimmage…late to read blocks or anticipate…impatient and gets bounce happy instead of trusting inside-run design…runs through defenders but he’s not an elusive runner…doesn’t have the speed to outpace linebacker pursuit to the corner – disaster athletic testing numbers during the pre-draft process…only one collegiate game with 20-plus offensive touches…inexperienced pass catcher…willing in pass pro but still in the development phase as a blocker.","A one-year starter at Georgia, Holyfield waited his turn behind Nick Chubb and Sony Michel his first two seasons in Athens before sharing the starting duties with D’Andre Swift in 2018. He and Swift had near identical production (both had 6.4 yards per carry), marking the second straight year Georgia had a pair of 1,000-yard rushers. Holyfield runs as expected as the son of a heavyweight boxer: tough as nails, grinding through contact and finishing forward. With most of his positive runs coming on the outside, he is late to read and set up moves in the hole, lacking a great feel as an inside runner. Overall, Holyfield must improve his tempo and decision-making as a runner and prove he can handle third-down situations, but his run power, quick feet and workhorse intangibles will be the welcome addition to an NFL backfield. His poor athletic testing numbers will remove him from several draft boards around the league.","6th-7th",.,14,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,159,1018,6.40251572327044,7,5,40,8,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.375,9,72.5,4.78,2.79,1.69,29.5,118,.,.,26

Scarlett was named a U.S. Army All- American and First Team All-State performer, also running track in high school.

After missing the 2017 season due to suspension, he took advantage of his second-chance in 2018 as part of an equal timeshare with Lamical Perine. Scarlett looks the part with a compact, durable body type and his aggressive running style, finding his top speed quickly to dart between open spaces in enemy territory. He makes sharp, lateral cuts to sidestep pursuit, but he needs to better set up his blocks, sporadically picking his spots.

Scott also made an impact on defense with 108 tackles and 10 interceptions over his prep career. He was the No. 2 recruit in Ohio and No. 6 running back nationally, holding offers from every major college program. Most thought he would stay in state and attend Ohio State, but he felt the Buckeyes were late and only recruited him hard once other backs committed elsewhere, driving him to Michigan State. After leading the Spartans in rushing his first three seasons, Scott battled injuries in 2018 and originally planned to redshirt (played in only four games in 2018), but changed his mind later in the year and suited up for the bowl game, leaving for the 2019 NFL Draft after the season. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl but was unable to participate due to injuries.","Above-average foot quickness and body control for a player his size…runs physical and balanced to shred arm tackles…attitude runner and slams through inside lanes…run violence makes him a chore to finish one-on-one…his stiff arm keeps defenders at bay…fluid lower body, shrugging off angled tackle attempts…foot quickness to patch together moves without gearing down…mostly a screen target, but he caught the ball when targeted, showing natural adjustment skills…offers upside in pass protection.","Attacks the line of scrimmage with tall pads…doesn’t always play up to his size and needs to be a more consistent finisher…tick late sorting things out, affecting his run tempo…one-speed runner and lacks burst…doesn’t have the suddenness to be shifty in the open field…seven career fumbles…off-field decision- making will be scrutinized after receiving double-digit driving infractions (driving without a license, etc.) in college – minor mistakes, but the high volume of citations shows a pattern that NFL teams won’t overlook…missed most of his senior season with an ankle injury.","A three-year starter at Michigan State, Scott led the Spartans in rushing his first three seasons before a forgettable senior campaign. He received top-100 grades from NFL scouts entering his final season, but injuries kept him from staying on the field. Scott is a tough player to tackle due to his contact-driven run style, but those physical hits will take a toll, leading to durability questions. Although he checks all the boxes physically, he doesn’t always play up to his measurables and needs to mature his run tempo and decision-making.

Despite zero starts as a senior, he rushed for 1,144 yards as he and Qadree Ollison became the first tandem in school history to both go over 1,000 yards in a season. For a well-built, physical ball carrier, Hall runs with quick feet to slash through holes and surprise pursuit angles at the second level, although he tested better than his athleticism on film. He averaged 7.5 yards per carry in 2018 but shared the load and is unproven as a pass catcher.

He averaged 25.3 yards on kickoff returns with two career scores. Johnson boasts outstanding burst, sticking his foot in the ground and exploding north. He wasn’t asked to be a bell-cow back, which made it tough for him to develop his feel and instincts as an inside runner. Although he has only average run strength, he is a strong-willed competitor.

Crockett is an above-average athlete, which is reflected on tape with his ability to knife through gaps and attack the second level, dropping his pads, driving his legs and finishing through contact.

He also lettered in baseball and wrestling, winning the 2015 state title in the 220- pound division. He finished his senior year 41-0 with a career wrestling record of 144-15, including 79 pins. Ingold was ranked as the No. 10 recruit in the state of Wisconsin and was recruited at different positions by different programs. He originally committed to Northern Illinois as a quarterback, but flipped to Wisconsin (his only power-five offer) as an athlete the week before signing day. Ingold started his college career at linebacker where he practiced for a few weeks, but was moved to offense in September 2015.

Despite an underwhelming workload as a ballcarrier, he averaged a touchdown every 5.6 touches (21 touchdowns on 117 offensive touches). An extension of Wisconsin’s offensive line, Ingold searches for collisions as a blocker and shows off his wrestling background, keeping his hips and pads low to deliver pop at contact. As a runner and receiver, he is reliable, but his average athleticism limits ways to get him the ball.

However, he is a straight-line player and his route tree needs more branches. The feedback from his medical evaluation will influence his standing on NFL draft boards.

He planned to play both football and baseball for the Rebels, but the outfielder was drafted in the 19th round of the 2016 MLB Draft and signed with the San Diego Padres, making him ineligible to play collegiate baseball.","Good-sized target with a filled-out frame…shows balance and body control as a route-runner…accelerates with juice off the line…capable of sticking his foot in the ground and making sharp turns off his plant…gravitates toward open spaces in the defense and always makes himself available…strong hands to pluck the football…quick to turn catches upfield and always knows where the sticks are…runs through contact as a ball carrier and doesn’t easily concede…works the middle of the field with a high level of toughness and confidence…physical blocker and takes pride eliminating defenders from the play…obsessive worker with the competitive nature and work ethic that rubs off on his teammates…highly productive and the only Ole Miss receiver with multiple 1,000-yard receiving seasons in a career, leaving Oxford as the most prolific receiver in school history.","Bad habit of rounding underneath patterns…wasn’t asked to create his own separation on downfield routes…benefited from working primarily out of the slot in college (69 percent of his career catches and 84 percent of his career touchdown catches came out of the slot)…not a make-you-miss threat as a ball carrier…guilty of allowing the ball to come to him at times and needs to aggressively work back to the ball, especially in contested situations…hasn’t given up his dream of also playing professional baseball.","A two-year starter at Ole Miss, Brown lined up primarily as the “Y” slot receiver in the Rebels’ three-receiver set and rewrote the school’s receiving record books. He established program records for single-season catches (85), yards (1,320) and touchdowns (11) and the career records for receiving yards (2,984) and 100-yard receiving games (12). Brown feasted on slants, crossers and shallow patterns in the Ole Miss offense and his tape feels like an unfinished jigsaw puzzle, missing a worthy sample size of downfield and outside-the-number routes. However, his athletic gifts at his size, along with his college production and ingrained work ethic, compare favorably to JuJu Smith-Schuster when he was a college prospect. Overall, Brown is a very natural route runner and pass catcher with the athletic profile and competitive character that make it easy to bet on his upside as an NFL starter.","1st-2nd",31,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,85,1320,15.529411764705882,6,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.875,9.75,78,4.49,2.65,1.56,36.5,120,.,.,19

After rushing for 1,353 yards and 28 touchdowns as a junior, he posted 1,584 rushing yards and 22 scores as a senior in 2013, earning All-State honors and finishing as the No. 2 rusher in school history. Campbell also led the track team to the 2013 outdoor state championship, taking home the top spot in the 4x100 and 4x200 relays and taking second in the 100 meters. He set personal bests in the 100 meters (10.75) and 200 meters (22.05) and broke the Ohio state record in the 60-meter dash. Campbell was the No. 22 wide receiver in the 2014 recruiting class and committed to Ohio State over Michigan State and Tennessee. Campbell, who skipped kindergarten, enrolled in Columbus at only 16 years old. He received an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl but declined.","Twitchy feet and moves differently than the other athletes on the field…instant acceleration and outstanding long-speed…able to brake and balance in the open field…weaves through congestion, forcing ankle-biting tackle attempts…improved focus and consistency finishing catches in 2018, posting an 82 percent catch rate (90 catches on 110 targets)…fluid body skills mid-air to locate and adjust…improved tempo as a route-runner, shifting between gears and working himself open…two-year team captain (former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer: “He’s an elite person and an elite worker”)…graduated with a degree in sociology (December 2018)…career year as a senior, setting the Ohio State single-season record for catches (90) in 2018, finishing with the sixth most catches (143) in school history.","Lacks polish as a route-runner…undeveloped footwork and cadence in/out of his breaks…unproven vertical threat…three catches of 40-plus yards (78, 71, 63) in 2018, but all three were catch-and-run plays (two were caught behind the line of scrimmage, one was 5 yards downfield)…doesn’t always play up to his                                                                                        [36]  speed-level due to indecisiveness…caught dancing and doesn’t have the run strength to overpower tackle attempts…returned kicks in college but doesn’t have punt return experience.","A three-year starter at Ohio State, Campbell made the transition from high school running back to wide receiver for the Buckeyes, lining up at “H-Back” in Meyer’s offense. He became only the fifth player in school history to reach 1,000 yards receiving in a season, joining David Boston, Terry Glenn, Cris Carter and Michael Jenkins. Campbell benefited from a high volume of underneath patterns (jet sweeps, screens, etc.), which showed off his electric athleticism as a ball carrier and inflated his production. His downfield abilities remain suspicious with inconsistent tracking skills, but he showed improved focus as a senior and impressed with his hands and downfield routes at the scouting combine. Overall, Campbell is a better athlete than skilled receiver as he enters the league with undeveloped vertical skills, but his short-area explosiveness and downfield potential are outstanding, projecting as a bigger, better version of his former teammate Curtis Samuel.","2nd",43,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,90,1063,11.811111111111112,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.25,9.5,75.625,4.31,2.51,1.52,40,135,4.03,.,11

As a senior, he totaled 61 receptions for 1,184 yards and scored 30 total touchdowns (15 receiving, 13 rushing, two interception returns). Samuel was considered the fifth-best recruit in South Carolina and committed to the Gamecocks (the team he grew up rooting for) over North Carolina and Vanderbilt. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Compact, muscular build (looks more like a running back than wide receiver)…strong lower body to power through contact…highly competitive with the ball in his hands…shows twitch in his routes to shake defenders at the stem…will lull coverage to sleep before shifting to another gear, gaining separation…excellent catch-and-run skills…strong, steady hands…doesn’t lack for toughness and finishes catches to the ground…impactful red-zone threat…impact kick returner in college, matching the SEC career record with four return touchdowns…holds the South Carolina record with a 29.0-yard kick return average…became the 10th player in school history to reach 2,000 career receiving yards…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018).","Ordinary height and length…doesn’t have the frame to shield defenders from the catch point…only average long-speed and will struggle to consistently stack cornerbacks…best plays on tape came vs. off-coverage or when given a free release…inconsistent tracking skills downfield…injuries hampered him throughout his career, including a history of hamstring issues going back to high school; missed most of 2017 after suffering a broken left ankle (September 2017).","A three-year starter at South Carolina, Samuel lined up outside and in the slot in the Gamecocks’ spread offense, often motioning into the backfield and getting involved in the run game. He also made an impact on special teams (return man and gunner on punt coverage) and had a nose for the end zone, scoring 30 touchdowns over his career (16 receiving, 7 rushing, 4 kickoff returns, 2 passing and 1 fumble return). Samuel isn’t a true burner, but he moves with twitch, contact balance and the vision to find open space. Overall, Samuel’s ideal offensive identity will depend on scheme, but he is one of the better YAC players in this draft class with his ability to find space, projecting best in the slot and as a return man.","2nd",45,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,62,882,14.225806451612904,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.375,10,75.125,4.48,2.66,1.6,39,122,4.14,7.03,15

He started playing football in eighth grade and developed into one of New Jersey’s top receivers, posting 54 catches for 829 yards and 16 touchdowns as a junior at Palmyra. Harmon earned First Team All-State as a senior with 1,111 receiving yards (best in New Jersey), adding 14 touchdowns, two punt return scores and 38 tackles as a safety on defense. He was a top-15 recruit in the state and committed to South Carolina before a shake-up on the coaching staff led him to decommit. Harmon reopened his recruitment and chose NC State over Miami (Fla.) on signing day. He elected to skip his senior year (and the bowl game) and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Above-average play strength and uses his size to his advantage…snatch-and-secure hands-catcher…natural tracking skills to locate, adjust and highpoint…maintains focus while jostling for position…displays a knack for creating late separation…comfortable in 50/50 situations…flashes the ability to snap off routes without gearing down…works the sideline well…quick feet and violent hands to defeat press…often requires gang-tackles by the defense to get him grounded…production improved each of the last three seasons with career highs in 2018.","Not naturally explosive…accelerates well but long-speed is average…mechanical lower body at the top of routes…will try and get a head start and prematurely round off patterns…routes require nuance to better set up corners…bad habit of unnecessarily jumping at the catch point…relies too much on pushing off, regardless if he needs to or not.","A three-year starter at NC State, Harmon played the “X” receiver position in the Wolfpack offense and finished his career with 2,665 receiving yards, which ranks third best in school history (behind Torry Holt and Jerricho Cotchery). NC State joined Oklahoma as the only FBS schools with a 3,000-yard passer (Ryan Finley), 1,000-yard rusher (Reggie Gallaspy) and two 1,000-yard receivers (Harmon, Jakobi Meyers) in 2018. While he needs to sharpen his routes, Harmon has a knack for creating early or late windows due to his (sometimes) subtle physicality to separate. Although not on the same level from a technical perspective, there are Michael Thomas flashes on his tape with his above-average ball skills. Overall, Harmon’s lack of an explosive top gear is bothersome, but he competes with outstanding play strength and the “my ball” mentality to track, adjust and finish.","2nd",51,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,81,1186,14.641975308641975,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.5,9.5,75.5,4.6,2.69,1.62,32.5,117,4.32,7.15,18

Growing up in Chandler, he spent his freshman and sophomore years at Tempe Marcos de Niza (teammates with Byron Murphy there) before transferring to Chandler for his junior year. Harry posted 30 catches for 657 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2014, leading Chandler to the Division I state title. As a senior, he recorded 48 catches for 802 yards and seven scores, earning all-state honors. Harry also averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds on the basketball court (his first love) and ran track (100 meters, 200 meters, 4x100 relay). He was considered the No. 1 recruit in the state and one of the best wide receiver recruits in the country, committing to Arizona State over Texas A&M and Washington. Harry declared early for the 2019 NFL Draft and skipped his bowl game.","Looks the part…large, strong hands…tracks well downfield and makes athletic adjustments on the football…maintains his focus through traffic, and defenders on his back don’t faze him…works hard to win body position…owns the elevation skills to climb the ladder…makes one-handed grabs look routine…coordinated feet to release and badger press coverage…physicality to be a tackle-breaker on slants and screens…forces defenders to finish him to the ground…smooth accelerator and picks up speed as he goes…consistent production with back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons…durable and plays through injury.","Not a burst player…overly methodical as a route-runner and savvy corners are able to stay in his hip pocket…lacks dynamic moves in/out of his breaks, struggling to uncover downfield…doesn’t set up defenders in his patterns…would benefit from improved hand use off the snap…only one red-zone touchdown in 2018 (on 10 targets).","A three-year starter at Arizona State, Harry played “X” receiver position for the Sun Devils, lining up primarily on the left side of the formation and occasionally in the slot. He finished his career No. 3 in school history in receptions and receiving yards, recording a catch in all 37 games he played. Harry competes with a powerful, fearless attitude, but will his physical play style produce in the NFL like it did vs. Pac-12 defenses? While he is a clean route-runner with natural ball skills, he lacks the separation quickness to give his quarterback sizable passing windows. Overall, Harry doesn’t have the sudden athleticism to blow past corners, but he wins downfield with his tracking skills and physicality to win body position, projecting as a solid No. 2 option or “big” slot in the NFL.","2nd",52,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,73,1088,14.904109589041095,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,33,9.5,78.25,4.53,2.67,1.62,38.5,122,.,.,27

He transferred to Deerfield Beach for his senior year and finished with 500 receiving yards and four scores. Ridley was a top-50 receiver in the 2016 recruiting class and passed on an offer to join his older brother at Alabama because he wanted to be his “own man.” He originally committed to South Carolina before his brother suggested he check out Georgia where Kirby Smart was recently hired. Riley decommitted from the Gamecocks and signed with the Bulldogs. His older brother (Calvin) was an All-SEC receiver at Alabama and first-round pick (26th overall) of the Atlanta Falcons in the 2018 NFL Draft. Ridley goes by his middle name to avoid confusion with his older brother’s similar first name. He skipped his senior season and entered the 2019 NFL Draft.","Looks good on the hoof with a tall, muscular frame…detailed route-runner…pushes patterns to proper depth with little wasted motion in/out of breaks…deadly on double-moves, understanding how to force cornerbacks off-schedule…hands-catcher with reliable hand-eye coordination…comfortable with throws away from his frame…excellent body control along the sideline…physical after the catch and won’t escape out of bounds (not a high volume tackle-breaker but goes down swinging)…finishes as a blocker and always looks for his next victim…nine touchdown catches in 2018 tied for second most in a season at UGA.","Adequate speed for the position but lacks explosive gears…NFL cornerbacks will match his burst…not elusive after the catch or a big-play threat (only two catches of 30-plus yards in 2018)…gives effort as a blocker but his angles and technique require attention…arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession (March 2017) after a traffic stop (disciplined internally by the coaches)…below-average production with career stats that look more like single-season production.","A two-year starter at Georgia, Ridley lined up as the “Z” receiver in the Bulldogs’ pro-style scheme, occasionally working out of the slot. Despite the underwhelming production, he led the team in catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions in 2018 for an offense that prioritized ground control and spreading the wealth through the air (trying to be the first wide receiver drafted top-50 without a 600-plus yard receiving season in college since Eddie Royal in 2008). Ridley isn’t a quick-twitch athlete and lacks the sudden acceleration to threaten defenses on speed alone, but he is smooth in/out of the drive phase with natural body control and ball skills. Overall, Ridley might not be as dynamic as his older brother, but he plays bigger and shows similar polish as a route runner, projecting as a better pro than college pass catcher.","2nd-3rd",59,14,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,44,570,12.954545454545455,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.625,10.25,78.25,4.58,2.69,1.57,30.5,124,4.28,7.22,13

After his mother passed away from breast cancer in 2012, Butler and his brother (Khalil) moved in with his aunt and uncle (Marian and Aaron Harrison) in Houston prior to his junior year in high school. He enrolled at Travis in 2013 and was an immediate standout in football and basketball, but was only eligible for half of the season due to transfer rules. As a senior, he earned All-Conference honors with 28 catches for 378 yards and five touchdowns in seven games (teammates with Kansas WR Steven Sims Jr.). Following his senior season, Butler ranked as the No. 271 wide receiver in the 2015 recruiting class and didn’t have any scholarship offers, unsure if he would play football again. However, FCS-level programs like Central Arkansas and McNeese State entered the picture, followed by Iowa State and Houston just days before signing day. Butler’s twin cousins (Aaron and Andrew Harrison) were like older brothers to him and played college basketball at Kentucky before professional careers. Butler elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Large-framed, loose-jointed athlete…immense catch radius and looks natural adjusting to inaccurate throws…downfield tracking skills make him a dangerous deep threat (10 catches of 50-plus yards the last two seasons, one of only three FBS receivers to do so)…acrobatic catches were routine on his film…uses his body to shield and overwhelm corners at the catch point, forcing flag-worthy reactions by defenders…strong-strider with the open field acceleration to outrace defenders when he has a straight-line path…flashes the foot quickness to shake pursuit, making it tough on defenders to ground him…graduated with a degree in liberal studies (December 2018)…set the school records for receiving yards (1,318) and yards per reception (22.0) in 2018.","Below-average route speed and separation quickness…needs to keep his long strides under control, coming unglued at the stem and rounding his breaks…struggles to sink his hips at the drive phase of the route…not a route-technician with mostly one-cut patterns on film, showing little deception to his path…inconsistent ball skills and will make catches tougher than they need to be…late adjusting to fastballs outside his frame…tends to favor body catching, corralling instead of attacking with his hands.","A two-year starter at Iowa State, Butler lined up as the “X” receiver in the Cyclones’ offense, lining up mostly outside and occasionally in the slot, and grew into one of the top big-play threats in college football. Leading the FBS with 22.0 yards per catch in 2018 (among receivers with 40-plus catches), he accounted for 10 of Iowa State’s 14 plays of 40-plus yards last season. Although he doesn’t have dynamic route speed or technique, Butler is a rangy athlete with the tracking skills to rebound the football. He is an accomplished jump-ball threat downfield, but the difficulty-level of finishing those plays skyrockets at the next level compared to the Big 12 (those 50-50 balls will be 20-80 balls in the NFL). Overall, Butler will have a tough time consistently separating from NFL cornerbacks, but his loose hips and flexible frame allow him to easily expand his catch radius, projecting as a potential mismatch weapon if he matures his routes and hands.","2nd-3rd",62,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,60,1318,21.966666666666665,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,35.25,10.75,83.875,4.48,2.62,1.59,36,128,.,.,18

Isabella received very little interest as a recruit with an offer from Air Force and several FCS-level programs. In the days before signing day, Massachusetts reached out with an offer and he accepted on the spot without visiting the campus or meeting the coaches. As a senior at Mayfield, Isabella ran the top 60-yard dash time in the nation (6.72) and won the 100- (10.51) and 200-meter dashes                                                                                        (21.27) at the 2015 Regional track and field meet, narrowly defeating Denzel Ward, who played cornerback at Ohio State and was drafted fourth overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 2018 NFL Draft.

He also set the UMass single-game record with 303 yards, becoming the only player in FBS history with 300-plus receiving yards in a game with fewer than 10 receptions. Isabella, who “couldn’t run a route” when he arrived in Amherst, needs to clean up his steps vs. press and at the stem, but he can create on in- and out-breaking routes due to his plant quickness and YAC skills. While he has quick hands, his focus and reliability can be disrupted by crowded catch points. Overall, Isabella’s undersized frame and catch radius might limit his role, but his explosive athleticism and receiving instincts will be a problem for NFL defenses, projecting best in the slot where he can manipulate space.","2nd-3rd",64,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,102,1698,16.647058823529413,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,29.75,8.375,71.5,4.35,2.52,1.53,36.5,121,4.15,6.95,15

Arcega-Whiteside grew up playing soccer, track and basketball, but started to gravitate toward football, playing varsity wide receiver as a freshman at Dorman. As a senior, he was named Gatorade South Carolina Player of the Year with 108 receptions for 1,824 yards and 20 touchdowns. Arcega- Whiteside earned all-state honors in three sports (football, basketball and track) during the 2013-14 season and was considered a McDonald’s All-American nominee in basketball.

His mother (Valerie) was an All-American at Appalachian State where she set 26 school records before playing overseas. His father (Joaquin) had a long career overseas and two of his uncles (Fernando and Jose) played for Spain in the 1984 Olympics. Arcega-Whiteside speaks three languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) and still speaks to his father in Spanish. He chose to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Good-sized, gangly target with outstanding length…boxes out without pushing off…magnet for defensive penalties due to frame and catch radius…hands catcher and extends with power to stab the ball away from his body…plays above the rim and owns jump balls, contorting his body mid-air…wasn’t asked to run a full route tree but collects his feet to make quick, crisp cuts…powers through arm tackles after the catch, dragging defenders…physically tough and takes a beating…2018 team captain…seven touchdowns on 11 red-zone targets, finishing No. 3 in the FBS with 14 touchdown grabs in 2018.","Struggles to separate vertically vs. speed…tightly wound in his hips and lower body…upright route runner with little deception, forecasting his path to cornerbacks…lacks diversity or burst in his releases or route setup…inexperienced making reads/adjustments based on coverage…looks to run before securing, leading to drops…missed at least one game each of the last three years due to injury, including a right ankle issue as a junior (November 2018); unable to work out at the scouting combine due to his right knee (February 2019).","A two-year starter at Stanford, Arcega-Whiteside improved each season in the Cardinal pro-style scheme, finishing second in school history with 28 receiving touchdowns. The best compliment you can give a wideout is when everyone knows where the ball is going, yet it can’t be stopped – and that’s often how it felt studying Arcega-Whiteside in jump-ball situations. His basketball background and bloodlines are evident in the way he boxes out and rebounds the football, especially in the end zone.

Boykin ranked as the No. 24 wide receiver and No. 3 recruit in Illinois, considering offers from Florida, Michigan and Missouri before ultimately choosing Notre Dame over Michigan State. His older brother (George) was expected to play college football or soccer before a brain contusion ended his athletic career in high school. Boykin elected to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Tall, long and toned frame…one-step acceleration to beat press and quickly enter his routes…eats up cushion without breaking stride…long-speed to strike fear in the minds of corners…fluid adjustment skills and looks like a nimble power forward in basketball…large, accepting hands, finishing catches away from his body with twitchy reflexes…swivel hips and steady concentration on fades and back shoulders, finding, stabbing and securing…strong leaping skills and uses his size/reach to his advantage…led the team in receiving in 2018.","Requires a moment to get back up to full speed after gearing down…needs to clean up his footwork at the break point…loses steam over the middle, hearing footsteps…too easily concedes at contact and doesn’t play up to his size after the catch…not a tackle-breaker and plays too calculating after the catch instead of thriving on instincts…suffered a fracture and multiple torn muscles in his left elbow (October 2014); dealt with finger injuries dating to high school, requiring surgery (March 2016)…only one season as a starter.","A one-year starter at Notre Dame, Boykin was the “X” receiver in the Irish offense, lining up in the boundary. He finished seventh on the team in receptions in 2017 before emerging as the go-to weapon through the air in 2018, leading Notre Dame in receptions (59), receiving yards (872) and touchdowns (8) as a junior. Boykin is an above-average size/speed target with the upper body flexibility to track, adjust and finish, swallowing the football at the catch point. To take the next step in his development, he must fine-tune his routes and turn up the dial of his aggressiveness to be a threat after the catch. Overall, Boykin doesn’t always play up to his measurables, but he is a premier athlete for his size with his best football in front of him (similar to Donte Moncrief as prospects), displaying the balance and body fluidity to develop into an NFL starter.","3rd",82,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,59,872,14.779661016949152,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,9.875,81.375,4.42,2.57,1.54,43.5,140,4.07,6.77,12

He ran an option-style attack in high school and earned Class AAA Offensive Player of the Year honors as a senior. Hardman was recruited for both offense and defense and was ranked as a top-15 recruit in the country, regardless of position. He narrowed his college choice to Clemson, Florida and Ohio State, but elected to sign with nearby Georgia (35 miles from his hometown). Hardman’s mother (Danyell) was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2013, which was a factor in his decision to stay close to home. He signed with the Bulldogs as a cornerback and played defense as a freshman before moving to wide receiver as a sophomore. Hardman ran track in high school (personal best of 10.64 in the 100 meters) and at Georgia, running the leadoff leg of the Bulldogs’ 4x100-meter relay team (finished sixth at the 2017 SEC Championships). He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Elite athleticism…uses track speed to destroy pursuit angles and run away from chasers…electric feet to shake and explode…creates easy vertical separation if corners don’t get a hand on him in press…dusts defenders on double moves, forcing defensive holding penalties…big-play creator (seven catches of 30- plus yards in 2018)…flashes the ability to pluck away from his frame…set a school record, averaging 20.1 yards per punt return in 2018 (16/321/1)…averaged 25.0 yards per kick return in his career…highly competitive by nature…has experience at cornerback.

Hardman, who wore the No. 4 jersey to honor former Bulldogs’ two-way star Champ Bailey, was also a standout return man and compares in ways to Adoree Jackson (elite athlete, dangerous returner, two-way player with “best position” questions). As a high school quarterback, he is still relatively new to wide receiver and it shows with inconsistent but promising routes and finishing skills, which is why some teams will look at him as an NFL cornerback. Overall, Hardman is undersized and unrefined, but he is a phenomenal athlete with the speed and suddenness in space to develop into an impact slot receiver and return man for an NFL team willing to be patient with his skill-set.","3rd-4th",92,14,5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,532,15.647058823529411,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.25,9,71.625,4.33,2.57,1.54,36.5,119,.,.,17

He started playing varsity as a sophomore and posted 33 catches for 820 yards and 12 scores as a junior. McLaurin earned Mr. Football honors as a senior in 2013 with 744 yards rushing and 953 yards receiving, scoring three touchdowns and recording an interception (at cornerback) in the 2013 state title win. He gave up basketball to focus on football but did run track, including a personal-best 11.39 in the 100 meters. McLaurin ranked as the No. 36 wide receiver in the 2014 recruiting class and held offers from Boston College, Iowa and Purdue until Ohio State offered, committing soon after. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Adequate height/length with cut-up muscle…checks boxes for timed speed and play speed…uses secondary burst on vertical routes, creating late separation (five catches of 40-plus yards in 2018)…tracks and adjusts to the deep ball…lateral start/stop quickness to beat press and gain a step at the top of routes…not forced to gear down at the catch point…toughness to secure catches and take hits…willing and effective stalk blocker…standout on special teams, making plays as a gunner on punt coverage…graduated with a degree in communication (December 2017)…two-time team captain…highly respected by his coaches and teammates for his good-natured personality.","Needs to sharpen his routes and better control his steps at the break point …bad habit of getting a head start and rounding patterns…physical defenders can throw him off his game…too many body catches on his tape, leading to drops…doesn’t have a high catch rate in contested situations…not a tackle- breaker after the catch…mediocre career production with only two 100-yard receiving games.","A three-year starter at Ohio State, McLaurin was part of a crowded wide receiver depth chart the past few seasons for the Buckeyes, but he carved out a role as a vertical threat, blocker and impact special teamer. He caught a touchdown every 3.9 catches in college (every 3.2 catches as a senior), finishing No. 6 all time at Ohio State with 19 receiving scores. McLaurin uses suddenness to beat press and the route quickness to create spacing downfield, and although he isn’t a tackle- breaker after the catch, he doesn’t make it easy on defenders. He takes pride in his team-first mentality and the coaches rave about his effort and football character. Overall, McLaurin needs to mature his route running and become a more consistent finisher to be more than a flash player on offense, but he is a smart competitor with the versatile athleticism to be a special teams ace while he climbs the wide receiver depth chart.","3rd-4th",93,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35,701,20.02857142857143,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.5,9.125,75,4.35,2.59,1.54,37.5,125,4.15,7.01,18

He was also one of the best track athletes in the state, winning state titles in the 100 meters (10.54) and 200 meters (21.51). On the football field, Slayton posted 39 catches for 788 yards and 12 touchdowns as a senior, earning All-State and U.S. Army All-American honors. He was recruited as both a wide receiver and cornerback and was ranked as the No. 16 recruit in the state of Georgia. Slayton fielded offers from Alabama, Ohio State, South Carolina and Tennessee before initially committing to in-state Georgia after his senior year. However, he flipped to Auburn on signing day. His cousin (Darrell Crawford) played linebacker at Auburn (1988-91). Slayton suffered a track injury his senior season in high school and was forced to redshirt in 2015. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Awesome speed…easy initial acceleration and sustains his pace to win vertically…efficient footwork to make hard stops mid-route…defensive backs must respect his deep speed, opening underneath options…flashes the foot quickness to frequently slip the first tackler, creating YAC…big-bodied target with the length to extend and make athletic plays on the football…body strength to keep his feet against off-balance tackle attempts…tracks deep throws well with 32 catches of 20-plus yards in his career (40.5 percent of his career receptions).","Too many focus drops on his college tape…allows impending contact (real or imagined) to disrupt his concentration…worked in a limited offense and needs to add more branches to his route tree…needs to be more efficient beating press coverage…holds the ball loose from his body, creating ball security concerns…lacks special teams experience…redshirted in 2015 after groin injury (from his senior year in high school running track), which required surgery (May 2015); minor injuries forced him to miss playing time the last two years.","A three-year starter at Auburn, Slayton was the boundary wideout in the Tigers’ spread scheme and was pigeonholed as the deep threat in the offense (accounted for eight career catches of 50-plus yards). With his track speed, he spent his much of his football life running past coverage and that wasn’t always the case in the SEC, forcing him to develop as a route-runner, which is an ongoing transformation. Slayton has the easy acceleration to push cornerbacks off the top of routes and the elusive feet to make defenders miss in space. He needs to continue his development in two key areas to reach his potential: expanding his route tree and becoming a better finisher when the ball is in the air. Overall, Slayton has inconsistencies to his game, but he is much more than simply a speed demon, showcasing fluid athleticism and length to make catches outside his framework, projecting as a high-upside developmental receiver.","3rd-4th",100,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35,670,19.142857142857142,5,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.75,10,79,4.39,2.62,1.56,40.5,135,4.15,7,11

He split his time between quarterback, wide receiver, defensive back and return man over his prep career. After a tough 1-9 season in 2013, Johnson spent more time at receiver as a senior and led Lennard to an eight-win season in 2014, recording 35 catches for 1,017 yards and nine touchdowns. He earned All-County and All-State honors as a receiver and return man. Johnson went overlooked as a recruit with only two FBS-level offers, committing to Toledo over Ball State. Johnson elected to skip his senior season at Toledo and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Excellent start/stop athlete and mixes his gears well mid-route…instant acceleration and eats up cushions without breaking stride…nifty moves at the stem…able to decelerate on command to generate separation…finds the blind spots of defensive backs and works toward open space…shifty athlete in space to leverage and manipulate pursuit…impact return man, averaging 20.2 yards per punt return at Toledo (17/343/2) with two touchdowns…also had two kickoff returns for scores, averaging 23.4 yards per return…his coaches say he is “passionate about his craft” and “coachable.”","Undersized build and won’t power through tackles…contact from physical corners too easily slows his patterns…requires route refinement…doesn’t always stay collected in his breaks, finding himself off-balance and wild…inconsistent route setup and needs to better sell hesitation patterns (double moves, stop- and-gos, etc.)…allows throws to get on top of him and needs to be a better finisher with his hands…limited catch radius and adjustment skills on throws off- center…missed the 2016 season with a broken foot (fifth metatarsal), requiring a screw.","A two-year starter at Toledo, Johnson was the “X” receiver in the Rockets’ offense, lining up primarily in the boundary. Over the last two seasons, he combined for four return touchdowns on special teams and led Toledo in receiving both years, including a school single-season record 1,278 receiving yards in 2017. Johnson spent much of his high school career at quarterback and it shows, lacking route discipline or attention to detail at receiver, but MAC cornerbacks struggled to keep up with his speed cuts and vertical athleticism. He showed improved stride manipulation and route pacing to sell double moves and hesitation patterns, but he must do it more consistently vs. NFL coverage. Overall, Johnson needs to mature his route-running and ball skills to be a more consistent threat, but his dynamic athleticism and special teams value can be weapons at the NFL level.","4th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,49,761,15.53061224489796,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.75,9,74.5,4.53,2.63,1.59,33.5,123,4.45,7.09,15

He also ran the 100 meters and won two AAU Junior Olympic track gold medals in 2011 in the pentathlon and high jump. After putting himself on the football recruiting map as a junior, Hall earned All-State honors as a senior receiver with 47 receptions for 889 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2014. Ranked as the second-best receiver recruit in the state, he originally leaned toward nearby Vanderbilt before James Franklin left for the Penn State job and the new coaches didn’t recruit him. Hall narrowed his college choice to Kentucky, Ole Miss and Missouri, choosing the Tigers prior to his senior season. His father (Daton) passed away unexpectedly midway through his senior season at Missouri. His mother (Shannon Simmons) won the Tennessee state championship in the 400-meter dash, long jump and pentathlon in 1994 and later ran and jumped collegiately at Tennessee as a heptathlete. Hall accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl but was forced to pull out due to his groin injury.","Elite vertical speed…owns an instant accelerator that changes how defenses gameplan…clean, sudden footwork at the line of scrimmage and in his cuts…able to slam on the brakes and drive corners off his path without losing balance…every route looks the same off the line of scrimmage…improved awareness in his patterns to catch defenders leaning…tall and long target…quick hands to adjust and spear throws away from his frame…big play waiting to happen, averaging 23.5 yards per catch and 14.9 yards per target the last two seasons.","Slender body type and lacks ideal mass…marginal play strength and can be overpowered mid-route…contested catches aren’t his game…inconsistent focus leads to drops…relied on linear patterns in Missouri’s offense and his route tree lacks diverse branches…history of lower body muscle injuries has kept him off the field, including multiple hamstring issues and a groin injury (September 2018) that sidelined him for a month as a senior (and kept him out of the Senior Bowl) – scouts have questioned his toughness to fight through minor issues.","A three-year starter at Missouri, Hall established himself as one of college football’s best deep threats the past two seasons (lined up only on the left side of the field), benefiting from a veteran quarterback (Drew Lock) in the Tigers’ air-it-out scheme. Missouri’s offense was night/day different with Hall in the lineup in 2018, going 7-0 in games he started and 1-5 in the six games where he was out or limited (Lock called Hall his “blankie,” adding he was “freezing” without him). With his instant acceleration and gliding speed, Hall stacks corners vertically and often had to wait for Lock’s deep ball to arrive. He improved on the drops as a senior but needs to develop better finishing skills and overall reliability (on the field and behind the scenes). Overall, Hall’s explosive speed and start/stop athleticism make him a tough cover at any level, but his injury history and inability to stay on the field are worrisome – a second-round talent but red flags lower his grade.","4th",.,9,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,37,828,22.37837837837838,6,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.25,9.75,79.375,4.39,2.59,1.54,43.5,141,.,.,15

His mother was a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), growing up in countries like Jordan, Egypt, South Africa and India. Fulgham moved back to the states for high school where he was a standout on the basketball court and also played soccer. He enrolled at Massanutten Military Academy as a junior and started playing football for the first time, posting 1,614 receiving yards and earning All-State honors. Fulgham transferred to Broad Run for his senior year where he started to receive scholarship offers, primarily from Division II programs. He wanted to play at the FBS-level and Old Dominion offered a walk-on opportunity, quickly earning a scholarship in his first year (August 2014). Fulgham’s mother (Celeste) played basketball at the University of Chicago. Along with pass rusher Oshane Ximines, they became the first Old Dominion players to earn invitations to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Large-framed athlete…uses physicality to separate at the top of routes or box out when targeted…excellent hand-eye coordination to adjust to the ball in flight…sure-handed…above-average length to expand his catch radius and snare…works with bodies around him…improved footwork and pacing as a route runner…able to stalk and sustain as a blocker, finishing with attitude…set a school record with a touchdown catch in nine straight games (his final nine collegiate games)…bet on himself as a walk-on.","More smooth than explosive…not a burner…lacks immediate burst and slow to eat up cornerback cushions…inconsistent gear change in his patterns…tends to drift and needs to tighten his route angles…doesn’t aggressively set up corners and still learning how to adjust to coverages…won’t frighten defenses as an after-the-catch threat.","A three-year starter at Old Dominion, Fulgham was the starting “Z” receiver in the Monarchs’ offense and led Conference USA in receiving yards per game (90.3) as a senior. Along with Jonathan Duhart, they became the first ODU tandem to each record 1,000-plus receiving yards in the same season. Fulgham is still relatively new to the sport after spending most of his time on the hardcourt, but he showed considerable improvement the last three seasons and qualifies as an ascending player. His speed is more build up than instant and the greatest obstacle awaiting him in the NFL is his lack of separation quickness to easily release or uncover vs. man coverage. Overall, Fulgham isn’t a twitchy athlete and needs time to fine-tune the details of the position, but his basketball athleticism is evident with his body control, adjustment skills and strong hands, projecting as a No. 4 wide receiver with starting upside.","4th",.,12,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,63,1083,17.19047619047619,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.75,9.5,80.375,4.58,2.7,1.6,36.5,126,.,.,15

He starred in basketball and football at Colonial Forge, playing quarterback, wide receiver, safety and return man. Jennings was a run-first quarterback and despite missing time due to injury, he finished his senior season with 810 yards passing and 620 yards rushing, adding 15 catches for 264 yards and three touchdown grabs. Jennings also helped lead Colonial to the school’s first basketball state championship in 2014. Due to his time at quarterback, he was only viewed as the No. 142 wide receiver in the 2015 recruiting class, but received offers from programs like Notre Dame and Wisconsin, ultimately choosing West Virginia over Virginia. Jennings accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Developed frame with a muscular build…outstanding timed speed matches his outstanding play speed…incorporates nuance at the top of patterns to create separation…not easily disrupted mid-route by physical defenders…perfectly functional ball radar to locate and gain body position…shows passionate fight after the catch, competing with attitude and using his body strength…responsible for 14 catches of 30-plus yards the last two seasons…graduated with a degree in sport management (December 2018)…productive career, finishing No. 6 in school history in receiving yards (2,294) and No. 7 in catches (168).","Drops off his hands were a consistent issue on his film…has the bad habit of unnecessarily jumping at the catch point…needs to do a better job along the sideline…didn’t face press coverage with inconsistent results when forced to make an early move before entering his route…eager blocker but technique is unsettled, leading to holding penalties…battled an ankle injury the second half of the 2018 season, missing the bowl game and parts of several other contests.","A two-year starter at West Virginia, Jennings lined up as the “H” slot receiver in Dana Holgorsen’s air-raid scheme, seeing snaps both inside and outside. He led the Mountaineers in receiving as a junior, but was given more downfield opportunities in 2018, which led to his touchdowns increasing from 1 to 13 and his                                                                                     [45]  yards per catch average from 11.3 to 17.0. Jennings’ production was partially inflated due to the Mountaineers’ pass-happy offense and a conference not known for defense, but he stood out at the Senior Bowl and combine, showing he isn’t simply a product of scheme. Overall, Jennings needs to improve his consistency at the catch point and as a route runner, but he is one of the more underrated players in this class, owning the size, speed and swagger that will help an NFL offense.","4th-5th",.,11,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,54,917,16.98148148148148,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.5,9.625,78.125,4.42,2.62,1.55,37,127,4.15,6.95,15

He made an immediate impact and finished his two-year prep career with 20 career touchdown catches, also earning All-State honors in basketball in 2013. Admittedly, Johnson “didn’t take school seriously” and he was forced to go the JUCO route, spending the 2014 season at Butler Community College. However, a coaching change led to his transferring, spending the 2015 season at Iowa Western Community College where he barely saw the field. Johnson was headed to Oklahoma State as a JUCO transfer for the 2016 season, but he fell one class short and had to stay at Iowa Western for the 2015 summer semester. The Oklahoma State spot was filled and his plan B (Marshall) wasn’t an option due to a coaching change, leaving Buffalo as his only remaining landing spot. Johnson has two cousins (Jadeveon Clowney and Johnathan Joseph) currently in the NFL. Johnson accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Natural body control and strong hands…tracks well over his shoulder…comfortable with a man on his hip, leveraging his body to time his attack…hides his intentions as a route runner, controlling his acceleration to stack corners mid-route…doesn’t allow physical corners to dictate his route path – more likely to attract a defensive flag than lose a pattern…good vision, run power and feel after the catch…improvises well on broken plays to find second chances for his quarterback…consistent production at the FBS level, becoming just the third player in school history with two 1,000-yard receiving seasons.","Speed is more build-up than instant…not straight-line explosive…mechanical at the top of patterns, lacking easy start/stop quickness to create mid- route…guilty of the not-so-subtle push off vs. aggressive corners…freelances his hands vs. press…not an elusive YAC threat and more likely to break tackles with his run power than his feet…good pop and potential as a blocker but needs better sustain.","A two-year starter at Buffalo, Johnson didn’t start playing football until 2012 and took a winding road to Buffalo before emerging the last two seasons, lining up both outside and in the slot. He leaves the program ranked top five in career catches (133) and touchdown receptions (25). Johnson’s basketball background is evident in his routes with his body control and physicality, finishing strong to the ball. He isn’t a bad athlete by any means, but nothing about his athletic profile screams special, and NFL corners will be a much tougher matchup than what he faced on tape. Overall, Johnson is a good example of a wide receiver being quick but not explosive, although his ball skills, toughness and instincts give him NFL starting potential, similar to Michael Gallup.","4th-5th",.,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,57,1011,17.736842105263158,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.375,9.375,74.625,.,.,.,32.5,122,.,7.12,18

He finished his career as the fourth-leading receiver in Sun Belt Conference history. Despite poor testing numbers, Hart is a twitched-up athlete with the short-area quickness to get in/out of his breaks before defenders can react. He is more than just speed, also showing craftiness at the stem to leverage coverage, forcing defenders off balance. Overall, Hart has obvious size/strength limitations and needs to eliminate the drops, but defenders struggle to match his instant burst, projecting as an NFL slot option and punt returner in the Taylor Gabriel mold.","5th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,49,669,13.653061224489797,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He followed that up with 63 receptions for 1,218 yards and 25 touchdowns as a senior, leading Cedar Hill to back-to-back Class 6A Division II state championships (was named the MVP of both title games). Lodge initially committed to Texas A&M after his junior year before flipping to Ole Miss on signing day. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Tall, long-legged athlete…avoids the jam and quickly eats up yardage vertically…twitchy route runner and shows snap at the stem…tracks the football well at every level and plays controlled at the catch point…owns a master’s degree in working the sideline…excellent awareness along the white to toe-tap…his coaches say he matured within the program (Ole Miss grad assistant: “Markus went from a boy to a man the last few years…he’s ready to be a pro.”).","High cut and plays upright, exposing his body to physical defenders…room to add muscle to better fend off press coverage…doesn’t have the body type to routinely break tackles or the elusiveness to make defenders miss…vanilla route tree in the Ole Miss offense…too many drops on tape (caught only 59.6 percent of his targets in 2018)…needs to improve his ball security.","A two-year starter at Ole Miss, Lodge finished as the No. 2 receiver (behind A.J. Brown) in the Rebels’ offense each of the last two seasons, setting career bests as a senior with 79.7 receiving yards per game (third best in the SEC). He shows the juice to work separation early and late, using his height, length and twitchy body control to adjust to throws away from his frame. He doesn’t always match the physicality of defenders in coverage and will need time to sharpen the details of his routes. Overall, Lodge is a tall, silky athlete who does some of his best work on sideline vertical patterns (very reminiscent of Marvin Jones when he was a prospect out of Cal), projecting as a No. 3 or 4 NFL receiver early in his career with the potential to develop into a starting “Z” wideout.","5th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,65,877,13.492307692307692,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.125,9.5,77,4.55,2.68,1.63,33.5,119,4.53,7.06,11

After Clarkson sent Lane Kiffin a highlight tape, Sills received a USC scholarship as a seventh-grader, which made national headlines. He attended Eastern Christian Academy (Md.) for high school, which was basically a football factory created by Sills’ father (David IV). After playing through a broken knuckle in 2012, he earned all-state honors as a junior in 2013, but missed most of the 2014 season due to an ankle injury. Now under Steve Sarkisian, USC planned to honor the scholarship, but with Ricky Town and Sam Darnold already part of the Trojans’ 2015 recruiting class, Sills decommitted. He was ranked as a top-25 pro-style quarterback recruit and received offers from Clemson, Michigan and Virginia Tech, but he chose West Virginia, which signed his former high school teammates Wendell Smallwood and Daikiel Shorts two years earlier. Sills started the 2015 season as the fourth-string quarterback and played wide receiver on the scout team to stay active. He initially declined a position change but made the move late in his true freshman season, catching a touchdown in his first career game. With the hope of playing quarterback, Sills transferred to El Camino College for the 2016 season where he was the starter, throwing for 15 touchdowns in 10 games. However, the offers didn’t come until Dana Holgorsen called and gave him the opportunity to return to Morgantown as a receiver. Sills accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Above-average height/length…long-striding acceleration makes him a legitimate deep threat…able to push the vertical stem before throttling down and working back to the ball…natural tracker, accurately judging the flight of the football to slow or accelerate…quick hands and reflexes to snare throws away from his frame…shows attention to detail in his patterns, using body leverage mid-route…initial quickness to gain free release vs. press…touchdown machine with 33 scores the past two seasons (most in FBS over that time)…blocking effort is there…senior captain…graduated with his degree in finance (December 2018).","Unimpressive body type with thin limbs and marginal build…below-average play strength and will struggle vs. physical defenders…press-man coverage in the NFL will be unlike anything he faced in the Big 12…doesn’t have the body power to break tackles or win contested situations…not much of a YAC or make-you- miss threat…limited route tree experience and tends to round out of his breaks…late to find soft spots in zone…steady focus, but has small hands and will have easy drops…limited upside as a blocker.","A two-year starter at West Virginia, Sills played every receiver position (X, H, Y, Z) in the Mountaineers’ offense and quickly developed chemistry with quarterback Will Grier (over the last two years, 67.5 percent of Sills’ catches resulted in a first down or touchdown). To his credit, he plays like a receiver, not a quarterback masquerading as a receiver, and he has fully bought in to his new position. Sills had elite touchdown production and his 35 touchdown grabs rank second in WVU history. Overall, Sills has concerning play strength and is still developing as a route runner, but he makes natural adjustments on the football with the athletic profile to work his way up a wide receiver depth chart, projecting similar to Los Angeles Rams receiver Josh Reynolds.","5th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,65,986,15.169230769230769,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,9,72.625,4.57,2.67,1.58,37.5,117,4.28,6.97,14

After earning District Offensive Player of the Year honors as a junior, he posted 81 catches for 1,484 yards and 22 touchdowns as a senior, adding 951 rushing yards and 20 scores on the ground. Mitchell was named Tennessee’s football Gatorade Player of the Year and earned the Tennessee Titans Mr. Football Award as the state’s best back. He was the No. 1 recruit in Tennessee (CB Joejuan Williams was No. 2) and the No. 34 receiver nationally, committing to Oregon over Alabama, Ohio State and Tennessee. Mitchell, who was mentored by former NBA All-Star Penny Hardaway, also planned to play basketball for the Ducks but decided to go football-only after arriving in Eugene. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Loose athlete with multiple gears…flashes an immediate burst off the line…drives off corners with the ability to brake and balance downfield…makes fluid adjustments on the football…efficient receiver-to-ball-carrier transition to create YAC…peripheral vision and senses defenders around him…gravitates toward open zones in the defense…enough vertical skill to stretch the seam (10 catches of 30-plus yards in 2018)…experienced lining up inside and outside…led the Pac-12 in receiving yards (1,184) in 2018.","Narrow-framed with lean features…needs to commit himself in the weight room and develop his strength…average hand strength, and his focus wanes, leading to drops…fazed by traffic and lacks consistency in contested situations…vulnerable vs. press…not a refined route runner, lacking rhythm to set up cover defenders…speed appears to tap out downfield, lacking a secondary burst…limited special teams experience…football character has been questioned by NFL scouts – missed the first half of the 2018 Oregon State game after he was late to a meeting.","A two-year starter at Oregon, Mitchell was the “Z” receiver in the Ducks’ spread offense and lined up across the formation, spending most of his time in the slot. His 1,184 receiving yards as a junior broke the Oregon single-season record and he dominated Pac-12 competition with 85.8 percent of his receiving yards (1,016) coming in conference play (one of four FBS players to record 1,000-plus receiving yards vs. conference opponents in 2018). A former prep basketball recruit, Mitchell is a nifty athlete and makes himself available downfield with his quickness and field awareness. He challenges coverage athletically but needs to add seasoning as a route runner and finisher, stylistically similar to Nelson Agholor. Overall, Mitchell is field fast with athletic twitch but will need to develop his strength and attention to detail at the NFL level to reach his full potential, projecting best in the slot.","5th",.,13,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,75,1184,15.786666666666667,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.5,9,74.375,4.46,2.59,1.55,36.5,122,4.29,.,12

At Southlake Carroll, he rushed for 1,828 yards and 29 touchdowns as a junior, earning All-State honors. As a senior, Humphrey rushed for 1,292 yards and 14 touchdowns but also took on more of a receiving role, posting 57 catches for 876 yards and eight scores in 2015. He also played varsity basketball and competed in the high jump on the track team. Humphrey was the No. 19 all-purpose athlete recruit and the No. 64 player in the state, ultimately choosing Texas over Wisconsin. After a breakthrough junior year, he elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Large-framed target with strong, confident hands…impressive focus and finish on 50-50 opportunities and crowded catch windows don’t affect his focus…highpoints with timing and power to outrebound over defenders…adjusts well to back-shoulder throws…fearless working the middle of the field…runs through tackle attempts, absorbing contact and escaping the grasp…uses a quick jab or lateral cut to get corners turned around…first non-quarterback at Texas with a passing, rushing and receiving touchdown since 1982…kick return experience…productive junior season (12 catches of 25-plus yards), finishing top-15 in the FBS in receiving yards.","Slow by NFL standards – ran a slower time at his pro day at 13 pounds heavier than the Combine…doesn’t offer much route savvy at this point in his development…not a burst player (off the line or out of breaks)…takes a moment to gather at the top of routes due to his long-striding gait…questionable route awareness…not a make-you-miss threat and his broken tackles will decrease vs. NFL defenders…high percentage of his production came out of the slot…suspended for the 2017 bowl game (marijuana) and his immaturity was well-documented in Austin.","A two-year starter at Texas, Humphrey lined up as the “H” receiver in the slot for the Longhorns, occasionally moving outside or taking snaps as a wildcat quarterback. He had a breakout junior campaign, becoming the ninth player in school history to reach 1,000 receiving yards in a season. A high school running back, Humphrey’s balance and toughness allow him to keep his feet and pick up yards after contact. He secures the ball well and had very few drops on film, but those tight windows were often a result of his immature routes and ordinary separation quickness. Overall, Humphrey is a better football player than wide receiver right now, but he is strong to the ball with athletic adjustments and reliable hands, projecting as a “big” slot option who will find open zones and make plays between levels of the defense.","5th-6th",.,14,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,86,1176,13.674418604651162,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.75,9.5,78.75,4.75,2.77,1.65,33.5,119,4.29,7.09,13

Keyshawn was a favorite of KeeSean’s father (Sean). KeeSean attended the same high school as Davante Adams (Johnson was a 5-foot-3 freshman when Adams was a senior) and the players have a close friendship. Johnson, who was also a guard on the basketball team, played wide receiver and defensive back at Palo Alto with moderate success his first three seasons. However, he physically matured as a senior (from 5-foot-7 to 6-foot-1) and posted 58 catches for 1,015 yards and 14 touchdowns, adding 38 tackles, three interceptions and three punt returns for touchdowns in 2013. Johnson received a little bit of FCS attention, but his recruitment grew midway through his senior year, ultimately following in Adams’ footsteps to Fresno State. His older brother (Vince Miles) played safety at San Jose State (2014-15) after transferring from Arizona. Johnson accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Fleet-of-foot receiver…quick release and vertical acceleration into his routes…twitchy reflexes, long arms and soft hands to pluck the football off his shoe tops or away from his body…excellent field awareness, understanding spacing, coverages and landmarks…has some juice post-catch to maximize plays…tougher than expected after the catch and won’t concede easily…reliable two-year team captain…ultra-productive, leading the team in catches, receiving yards and touchdowns three straight seasons.","Accelerates quickly but speed taps out…more of a glider than elusive start/stop athlete…slender frame, lacking ideal bulk…play strength isn’t an asset, especially early in the pattern and as a blocker…guilty of bracing himself for contact on middle-of-the-field routes…inconsistent physicality at the catch point and doesn’t have a high batting average on downfield balls…average leaper.","A four-year starter at Fresno State, Johnson lined up across the formation for the Bulldogs, seeing time inside and outside. He leaves school with the most catches (275) and receiving yards (3,463) in school history, setting the MWC record with at least one catch in 50 straight games. Johnson is a quick-footed, gliding athlete and does a nice job finding open passing lanes for his quarterback. While quick out of the gate, he struggles to control his field speed mid-route with below-average play strength and short-area burst. Overall, Johnson is a smooth pass catcher due to his natural instincts and soft hands, but he needs to pay closer attention to the details to help mask his average speed and strength, projecting as a No. 4 NFL receiver who can work his way up the depth chart.","5th-6th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,95,1340,14.105263157894736,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,9.5,75.75,4.6,2.69,1.62,30,117,4.23,7.28,14

He played quarterback and safety and earned all-county honors as a senior, recording 1,834 passing yards, 534 rushing yards and 31 total touchdowns. Not widely recruited, Meyers didn’t crack the top-50 dual-threat quarterbacks in the 2015 recruiting class, committing to Kent State the summer before his senior season. Interest picked up closer to signing day and he switched his commitment to NC State (over Wake Forest and Florida) after the Wolfpack had a quarterback (Austin King) flip to Indiana. Meyers missed chunks of his redshirt season in 2015, seeing action as the scout team quarterback. Entering the 2016 season, transfer Ryan Finley won the starting job and Jalen McClendon (who later transferred to Baylor) was the backup, leading Meyers to transition to wide receiver a week prior to the 2016 season opener. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft, accepting an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Good-sized catch radius, tracking and elevating over defenders…steady hands…catches well in stride…uses route leverage and physicality to open pockets of space…runs well when he has a lane…doesn’t play timid over the middle of the field…worked hard to add weight, putting on 30 pounds since arriving as a 174-pound freshman…described as “reliable” and a “people person” by those close to him…graduated with his degree in sports management (December 2018)…set a school record with 92 catches in 2018, leading the ACC with 7.7 receptions per game.","Not technically proficient at the position…leggy and doesn’t sink in/out of his route breaks…lacks suddenness as a route runner and often tips his path…average play speed and doesn’t show multiple gears…not going to break many tackles with cornerbacks routinely getting him on the ground…worked primarily out of the slot with limited tape vs. press coverage…battled a knee issue during his redshirt season, requiring surgery.","A two-year starter at NC State, Meyers worked exclusively at the “H” position (slot) and developed into one of the key weapons on the Wolfpack’s offense, breaking Torry Holt’s school record for catches in a season. NC State joined Oklahoma as the only FBS schools with a 3,000-yard passer (Finley), 1,000-yard rusher (Reggie Gallaspy) and two 1,000-yard receivers (Meyers, Kelvin Harmon) in 2018. As a former quarterback, Meyers shows an understanding of how to work toward open space and use field leverage, but he needs to sharpen his route running to match up with NFL cornerbacks. As an athlete, there is plenty to like but not much to love, lacking dynamic feet or an explosive top gear. Overall, Meyers has adequate speed, size and ball skills for the position, but he doesn’t play with burst or the details required to easily create separation, comparing to former Michigan wide receiver Amara Darboh.","5th-6th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,92,1047,11.380434782608695,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,9.5,76.5,4.63,2.66,1.56,37,118,4.23,7.07,13

At 5-10 and 150 pounds, Renfrow went overlooked as an FBS recruit, receiving offers only from FCS-level programs like Appalachian State. He attended a camp at Clemson and was offered a preferred walk-on opportunity, which he quickly accepted. Renfrow had several family connections to the school with his mother (Suzanne), brother (Jordan) and grandfather (Harold Clemmons) all Clemson alums. He was also a standout prep baseball player and received several collegiate scholarship offers. Renfrow’s father (Tim), who coached at Socastee for 10 years (2003-12), was a prolific shortstop and cornerback at Wofford College and still holds the career records for stolen bases (84) and interceptions (19).

After six touchdown catches as a junior, he posted 48 catches for 670 yards and 11 touchdowns as a senior, earning All-District honors. Wesley also ran high school track and finished second in regionals in the long jump (22-2 3/4). He wasn’t ranked as a recruit when Texas Tech extended him an offer, which was the lone FBS-level scholarship he received. The coaches hoped to redshirt him in 2016, but injuries at wide receiver ended that idea. After his breakout 2018 season, Wesley elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Loose-jointed and doesn’t move stiff…long body to extend outside his frame with reliable ball skills…skilled at climbing the ladder and making difficult catches look routine…picks up speed once he stretches out his long strides…capable of sharp, decisive cuts at top speed…fleet of foot to sidestep tackle attempts and tightrope the sideline…led the FBS with 17 catches of 30-plus yards in 2018…led the Big 12 in catches (88) and his 1,410 receiving yards is the third most in a single season in Texas Tech history.","Gangly frame and needs time in the weight room…looks lost when defenders get physical with him in press or downfield…below-average play strength and inconsistent working for body position…focus disrupted on 50-50 chances…doesn’t have explosive speed to easily shake coverage…quick-footed, but lower body is all over the place in/out of breaks…doesn’t consistently use body fakes or creativity in his routes…unproven deep threat – most of his big plays came on yards after the catch…only one year of production.","A one-year starter at Texas Tech, Wesley earned the starting “X” receiver role as a junior (only lined up on the left side of the formation) and had a breakout season. Despite catching passes from three quarterbacks, he finished as one of only three FBS receivers with 1,400-plus receiving yards in 2018, ranking second nationally in receiving yards per game (117.5). Wesley has steady ball skills with the catch radius of a big man but the hip/joint flexibility of a much smaller athlete. While his tape shows flashes of promise as a route runner, he isn’t there yet and his average speed makes it too easy for receivers to stay in his hip pocket. Overall, Wesley lacks route polish and struggles with physicality, but he is a large, rangy target with outstanding hand-eye coordination and body control, projecting as a developmental wideout.","6th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,88,1410,16.022727272727273,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,9.75,79.75,.,.,.,37,117,4.26,7.07,6

He finished his senior year with 1,883 passing yards, 1,139 rushing yards and 39 total touchdowns, earning Second Team All-District honors. He was rated as the No. 413 wide receiver in the 2014 recruiting cycle and received only one FBS-level offer, committing to Toledo as a wideout. Thompson received a medical redshirt after breaking his right leg midway through the 2017 season.

With a school-record 56 games under his belt, he leaves Toledo as the school’s all-time leader in touchdown catches (30) and second in receiving yards (3,312) and yards per reception (18.3). Thompson averaged over 19.0 yards per catch three straight years but wasn’t the same downfield threat after his leg injury, recording only two catches of 30-plus yards (and none over 40 yards) in 2018. Although his lack of burst will be tougher to mask vs. NFL defenses, his short-area quicks and skilled routes are translatable assets. Overall, Thompson isn’t a dynamic separator out of his breaks, but he is instinctive and sure-handed with the competitive juices that help equate to production, projecting as a Justin Hardy type of No. 3 or No. 4 receiver in an NFL offense.","6th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,48,647,13.479166666666666,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,31,9.375,74.625,4.57,2.66,1.61,38.5,119,4.03,6.87,19

Johnson ranked as the No. 154 receiver nationally and the No. 14 recruit in the state of Indiana, receiving mostly MAC offers and committing to Toledo. His father (Jason), who coached him at West Side, was a wide receiver at Illinois State and played three seasons in the NFL. Johnson’s cousin (Lonnie) played cornerback at Kentucky and is a draftable prospect in the 2019 NFL Draft class.

Despite coming off the bench most of his career, he found ways to impact games, leading the team with three 50-plus catches in 2018 and setting the school record with the longest play from scrimmage (98-yard catch). Johnson has the type of speed capable of creating consistent separation at the top of routes, which defenses must respect. However, there is a lot of feast or famine on this tape due to raw routes, footwork and technique. He also lacks experience on special teams. Overall, Johnson relies more on pure athleticism than nuance as a pass catcher, but his electric speed can create mismatches, projecting as a poor man’s version of Phillip Dorsett.","6th-7th",.,13,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,660,20.625,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He earned Offensive Player of the Year honors as a junior with 56 catches for 1,402 yards (25.0 average) and 14 touchdowns in 2013, adding three punt returns and two interceptions. Williams tallied 43 receptions for 916 yards and 13 scores as a senior before suffering a season-ending knee injury. He was the 2013 Georgia state champion in the long jump (24-2.5) and the runner-up in the triple jump. Ranked as the No. 7 receiver in the 2015 recruiting class, Williams held offers from every major program in the southeast and committed to Tennessee over Alabama, Auburn and Georgia (he was asked to leave an Auburn recruiting visit for being disruptive). He was ruled eligible in 2015 after retaking the ACT weeks before the season started. Midway through the 2016 season, Williams elected to leave the program and later signed with Colorado State (head coach Mike Bobo recruited him while he was a coordinator at Georgia), sitting out the 2017 season due to transfer rules. He also found off-field trouble after he enrolled and was suspended from the football program following a September 2017 arrest. Williams rejoined the team prior to the 2018 season and put together a strong junior year, deciding to leave early for the 2019 NFL Draft. He wasn’t invited to the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine due to his past off-field issues.","Athletic, rangy frame with a sizable wingspan…long, easy strides to stack corners and win vertical routes…fluid body type to sink and burst at route breaks…finds his top speed quickly to release and get cornerbacks off balance…limber body type to track, adjust and finish throws away from his frame, expanding his catch radius…terrific leaping skills to play in the clouds…flashes after-the-catch athleticism to shake defenders and run away from pursuit…productive final season in college with receiving numbers that rank top-three in Colorado State history for a single season.","Needs to eliminate the drops…undeveloped route runner with obvious tells, giving defenders a sneak peek at the pattern…inefficient footwork at the stem, struggling to consistently separate…wasn’t often challenged at the line of scrimmage…known to have coachability problems…needs to shed the “lazy” label and prove commitment to his craft (NFL scout: “He loves fashion more than football”)…has a history of hamstring injuries, missing four games as a freshman (October 2015) and parts of others over his career; suffered a torn ACL (November 2014) as a senior in high school…off-field decision-making is a red flag, specifically an arrest where he was charged with harassment, tampering and domestic violence (September 2017) after he allegedly shoved his girlfriend multiple times; he was arrested three weeks later (October 2017) for violating the restraining order.","A one-year starter at Colorado State, Williams’ first three years after high school were a disappointment, fizzling at Tennessee and finding trouble once he transferred to Colorado State. He posted 96 catches (third best in FBS), 1,345 yards (fourth best) and 14 touchdown catches (third best) in his one full season on the field in 2018. While he requires improved attention to detail as a route runner and finisher, Williams is a rare talent with his rangy athleticism and overall upside. However, character and commitment questions have followed him since high school, most recently with a disappointing pro day workout. Overall, Williams has the God-given traits to develop into a true No. 1 receiver in the NFL with his size, length and athleticism, but his track record of immaturity will be a deal-breaker for most NFL teams.","6th-7th",.,12,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,96,1345,14.010416666666666,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

On the football field, Ferguson posted 889 receiving yards and 10 touchdown catches as a senior, adding 561 rushing yards and seven scores on the ground. On defense, he tallied 87 tackles and four interceptions. Ferguson was the No. 12-ranked recruit in Louisiana and the No. 36 receiver nationally, committing to in-state LSU. He spent two seasons in Baton Rouge before his academics slipped and he struggled to find the field. Ferguson transferred to FCS-level Northwestern State and sat out the 2017 season to get his grades in order. After an All-American 2018 campaign, he decided to skip his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.

Ferguson shows his basketball background at the catch point, expanding outside his frame to make impossible grabs and help bad throws look average. He has the speed to win on vertical patterns but requires route refinement and better understanding of coverages.

Godwin considered offers from Alabama, Auburn and USC before deciding to stay close to home and sign with Georgia, which recruited him as an offensive-only player. Following his high school graduation, he was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 33rd round of the 2015 MLB Draft but didn’t sign.

After finishing second on the team in receiving in 2017, he ranked sixth in catches on the Bulldogs as a senior, but it was a crowded depth chart (one of five pass catchers to finish 2018 between 370-570 receiving yards). On tape, Godwin was at his best on one-cut routes, using the burst off his plant foot to gain a step of separation, especially over the middle where he could catch and go. He lacks the play strength to easily uncover vs. physical defenders and doesn’t run the full route tree like most teams expect from their inside receivers.

Overall, Knox is a fascinating prospect because his athletic traits and infrequent flashes on tape suggest he has NFL starting upside, projecting best in a zone scheme, but is he a sleeping giant or better athlete than football player?","3rd",85,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,15,284,18.933333333333334,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,9.75,80.5,.,.,.,34.5,.,4.27,7.12,16

After starting his high school career as a quarterback, he hit a six-inch growth spurt and moved to tight end and defensive end for his final two seasons. After helping Kingfisher to the 2013 state championship, Sternberger finished his senior year with 42 receptions for 390 yards and eight touchdowns, adding 21.0 sacks on defense. He wasn’t ranked among the top-50 tight ends in the 2015 recruiting cycle and committed to Kansas (his only offer from a Power Five program) as part of David Beaty’s first recruiting class. After redshirting in 2015 and seeing little action in 2016, Sternberger elected to transfer because tight end was underutilized in the Jayhawks’ offense. He enrolled at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M for the 2017 season (teammates with Utah State running back Darwin Thompson) and posted 21 catches for 336 yards and six scores, attracting attention from FBS programs. Sternberger was leaning toward Boise State until Jimbo Fisher was hired at Texas A&M and offered him a scholarship, becoming the first commitment of the Fisher era. His mother (Jackie) was a two-time All-American basketball player at Southeastern Oklahoma State in the late 1980s; his paternal grandfather played football at Southeastern Oklahoma. After one season in College Station, Sternberger decided to skip his senior year for the 2019 NFL Draft.","Fleet of foot athlete…uses a swift release to quickly accelerate into his routes…strong to the football and finishes in crowded windows…comfortable working the middle of the field and skinny posts…highly competitive as a ball carrier and keeps his legs churning at contact, not going down easily…big-play threat due to his seam and YAC skills (six catches of 30-plus yards in 2018)…productive when the field shrinks, scoring five of his FBS-best 10 touchdowns in the red zone…willing blocker, using leverage and a hard shoulder…coaches speak highly of his work ethic and conditioning habits…highly productive 2018 season, including the school record for touchdown catches by a tight end (only the second FBS TE over the last decade with 17.3-plus yards per reception and 10-plus touchdowns in a season).","Lean-muscled player and lacks ideal bulk…allows the ball to get on top of him at times…not a detailed route runner at this point in his development…inconsistent sink and snap when attempting to leverage route breaks…late to cut off rushers as an inline blocker…hands land wide, leading to off- balance reps at the point of attack…only one season of top-level production in college.","A one-year starter at Texas A&M, Sternberger quickly emerged as the centerpiece of the Aggies’ passing game, lining up split out, wing or inline. Despite only one season in College Station, he is one of the most productive tight ends in school history, setting the single-season records for receiving yards and touchdown catches. With his athleticism and toughness, Sternberger offers tremendous YAC and down-the-seam value, recording at least one 20-plus yard catch in 12 of 13 games in 2018 (44 percent of his catches resulted in a 20-plus yard play). He is a work-in-progress as both a route runner and blocker and his NFL ceiling will be closely tied to his development in both areas. Overall, Sternberger is a vertical pass-catching target with the athleticism and warrior toughness to be a mismatch weapon, projecting as an NFL joker tight end.","3rd",87,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,48,832,17.333333333333332,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.125,9.75,77.25,4.75,2.82,1.7,31.5,113,4.31,7.19,17

Playing wide receiver and linebacker, he combined for 42 receptions for 608 yards and eight touchdowns his final two seasons at Paso Robles, earning All-State honors in 2014. Playing at a program not known for producing Division I athletes, Oliver went under-recruited with only three offers, committing to San Jose State over Air Force and Sacramento State. He didn’t know if he would be playing linebacker or tight end for the Spartans, but they kept him on offense. Oliver’s father (Rene) was a cornerback at Cal Poly in the late 1980s; his uncle (Clancy) played defensive back for three seasons in the NFL; his second cousin (Darren) pitched for 21 seasons (1993-2013) in MLB. Oliver accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Good-looking athlete with a defined frame…massive hands and accepts the ball well…adjusts and makes full-extension grabs look routine…smooth change-of-direction athlete and runs well for the position…shifts his gears well as a route runner…his coaches call him an “enthusiastic” blocker, staying balanced to be reliable inline…cleaned up his nutrition, dedicated himself in the weight room and transformed his body (San Jose State head coach Brent Brennan: “He’s one of the best players I’ve ever been around regarding how they go about their business. Totally committed.”)…senior captain…productive senior season, finishing second in the FBS in receptions (56) among tight ends (despite San Jose State having three quarterbacks start multiple games).","Smooth athlete, but not sudden in/out of breaks, limiting his separation skills…routes can be too easily disrupted by physical defenders…added new patterns each season, but his route tree is still blooming…needs to cut down on the drops (54 percent catch rate)…inconsistent results on contested throws…only one red-zone touchdown to his name…only average finishing strength as a blocker…lacks the burst out of his stance to slow edge rushers in pass pro…caught leaning and will get tossed.","A four-year starter at San Jose State, Oliver spent his first two seasons as a blocking tight end, which was a blessing in disguise since he didn’t do much blocking in high school. The past two seasons, he developed into a productive pass catcher, including a breakthrough senior year, lining up inline, wing and detached. The Spartans had “FTS” (Feed The Stud) play calls specifically to get Oliver the football with 38 of his 56 catches resulting in a first down or touchdown (67.9 percent rate ranked second in the FBS). His athleticism doesn’t always translate to his blocking reps and he won’t overpower NFL defenders as an inline blocker, but he can do enough to wall off lanes. Overall, Oliver doesn’t offer any “special” on-field qualities, but his athleticism and fluid adjustments on the football will keep him employed in the NFL, projecting as a steady “F” option.","3rd-4th",99,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,56,709,12.660714285714286,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,10.75,78.875,4.63,2.76,1.66,34,117,4.47,7.21,22

He convinced his coaches to keep him at tight end over moving to the offensive line and finished his prep career with 144 receptions for 2,260 yards. Smith was named District MVP and First Team All-State as a senior with 57 catches for 917 yards. He started receiving scholarship offers as a freshman (Clemson) and was considered the No. 2 tight end recruit (behind Georgia’s Isaac Nauta) in the 2016 class, committing to Stanford over Alabama, Texas and a dozen other programs. Smith chose to skip his final two seasons and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Ready-made size and bulk for the next level…large hands and strong to the football, attacking high and away from defenders…above-average hand-eye coordination and tracking skills (also an impressive juggler)…efficient quickness at the top of routes to maintain speed out of his cuts…always in attack mode, working back to the ball…finds soft spots in the defense…comfortable in a crowd…clean acceleration off the snap to threaten the vertical seam…high-effort blocker…shields well in pass protection and as a run blocker with the balanced feet to hold up in space.","Not an explosive mover or leaper…physical finisher but not a tackle-breaker or consistent YAC threat…only two touchdowns in 2018 and not a proven red-zone threat (two catches, zero scores in the red zone in 2018)…needs to load more ammo into his punch to decisively extend and drive defenders…needs to improve his blocking technique to better sustain…missed the final three games with a foot injury (November 2018); tore his ACL and MCL playing basketball his senior year in high school, requiring surgery (January 2016).","A one-year starter at Stanford, Smith took over the starting duties from Dalton Schultz and lined up primarily inline and in the slot, finishing 2018 as one of only eight FBS tight ends with 600-plus receiving yards despite missing three games. He was groomed in an offense where blocking is celebrated and will be the sixth Stanford tight end drafted in the last eight years. As a blocker, Smith has clean feet and the competitive mentality required, although he will benefit from continued development of the details, especially with his handwork. As a pass catcher, he doesn’t have the explosive traits to uncover at will, but he is coordinated out of breaks with vice grips for hands, meaning he is open, even when he is covered. Overall, Smith has adequate blocking skills and route athleticism, but his above-average technique at the catch point is what separates him, projecting as an NFL starter.","4th",.,10,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,47,635,13.51063829787234,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.25,9.625,78.125,4.92,2.86,1.69,32,108,4.47,7.08,15

He tallied only 21 catches over his prep career (8 as a senior, 12 as a junior and 1 as a sophomore), but 11 went for touchdowns, averaging 23.6 yards per reception. Sample earned First Team KingCo 4A honors his junior and senior years and was considered a top-15 recruit in the state. He initially committed to Boise State before switching to Washington when Chris Petersen left his post for the Broncos to take over as head coach for the Huskies. Sample married his wife (Angelina) in July 2018. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Prototypical size for the position…rolls into blocks and stays balanced at contact…stays square in pass pro and keeps his punch alive to knock down hands and run rushers wide of the pocket…able to stun and seal defensive ends, opening outside run lanes…soft hands with very few drops on film…tracks the ball well over his shoulder and makes proper adjustments…improvises well with his scrambling quarterback…married and considered a mature player (Huskies tight ends coach Jordan Paopao: “Every single day he is the model of what it should look like.”).","Below-average production and usage as a pass catcher (35 targets in 2018)…dull at the top of routes…restricted route tree on film, running mostly crossers and simple sit-down patterns…can get pinballed in his release off the line…limited after the catch and a beat late transitioning to a ball carrier…doesn’t offer any explosive or elusive moves as a runner…controlled but not overpowering as a blocker…missed three games as a junior with a leg injury (September 2017).","A four-year starter at Washington, Sample saw plenty of playing time the past four seasons with the Huskies using plenty of “12” personnel packages, lining up inline and wing. By far, his most productive season came in 2018, but he managed only 1.8 catches and 18.0 receiving yards per start with only three targets in the red zone. Tight ends must have a healthy appetite for blocking in Chris Petersen’s offenses and Sample certainly does, competing with the same edge and consistency each snap. He isn’t as powerful as Will Dissly (former UW tight end who was a fourth-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft), but he is a better athlete with higher upside as a receiver. Overall, Sample has a small sample size as a pass catcher and might not be elite in any one area, but he is well-rounded and trustworthy, projecting as a classic “Y” tight end who will compete for playing time as an NFL rookie.","4th-5th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,25,252,10.08,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.375,9.625,79.25,4.71,2.73,1.64,33.5,115,4.31,7.15,.

He was more accomplished on the hardcourt, finishing his career with 1,500-plus points and the school record for points, rebounds and assists. As a senior, he posted 22.2 points and 13.5 rebounds per game, earning First Team All-State honors in 2014. On the football field, he was a wide receiver as an underclassman (12 touchdown catches as a junior) before playing quarterback as a senior. He was on pace to become the first in school history with 1,000-plus yards passing and 1,000-plus yards receiving before a meniscus injury sidelined him for the second half of his senior year. Wesco received plenty of recruiting attention in both sports, but he didn’t have the grades to qualify and was forced to go the JUCO route, enrolling at Lackawanna College. He caught just five catches in 2014 as a backup tight end and missed the 2015 season due to a knee injury. Wesco received scholarship offers from Buffalo, UCF and West Virginia, committing to the Mountaineers with three years of eligibility remaining. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Angular, brawny frame with long arms…battering ram as a blocker…shocks the chest of defenders with his hands and drives his legs…aggressive appetite required for a lead blocking role…quickly accelerates into his routes…competes with a “my ball” mentality to overpower defenders mid-air…steady hands and focus, finishing away from his body…physical after the catch with eight of his 26 catches in 2018 going for 20-plus yards…graduated with his degree in multidisciplinary studies (August 2018)…proven position flexibility at fullback and tight end.","Thrives on adrenaline, getting out of control with his blocking angles at times…hand placement requires added consistency…landmark route runner and doesn’t show much tempo or nuance in his patterns…one-year starter…doesn’t have a large sample size as a pass catcher with only 42 combined targets the last five seasons at JUCO and WVU…the ball routinely beats his hands to catch point, forcing him to spear instead of accepting it…history of knee issues, missing the second half of his senior year (2013) and his sophomore season (2015) at Lackawanna.","A one-year starter at West Virginia, Wesco played a hybrid fullback/tight end role in Dana Holgorsen’s version of the air-raid offense, splitting his time on the wing, inline and as a lead blocker. The Mountaineer coaches glowingly talk about his growth as a blocker, something he wasn’t asked to do much until he arrived in Morgantown. A former standout basketball player, Wesco embraces the physical, smash-mouth style, flashing the nasty streak and desire required to do the dirty work. As a pass catcher, he recorded only 28 receptions in three seasons at West Virginia, but he was reliable when the ball was thrown his direction, catching 26 of his 30 targets in 2018. Overall, Wesco isn’t a polished pass catcher and needs to play more controlled, but his competitive toughness and versatile upside are worth betting on, projecting as a developmental NFL backup.","4th-5th",.,12,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,26,366,14.076923076923077,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.75,9.5,81.5,4.89,2.84,1.71,31,117,4.38,7.18,24

On the football field, he helped lead Jesuit to the program’s first state championship in over 50 years as a senior, earning 2014 Second Team All-State honors with 37 catches for 550 yards and seven touchdowns. Not highly regarded as a recruit, Moreau ranked as the No. 74 tight end nationally and the No. 86 player in the state. He didn’t have any offers from Power Five programs and appeared headed to Tulane before Les Miles and LSU called on signing day, offering him a scholarship spot that just opened. His mother (Tricia) was a collegiate volleyball player at Tulane. Moreau accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Accelerates smoothly off the line to enter his routes…flashes natural hands…maintains focus with bodies around him…doesn’t play sudden out of his breaks but there is little wasted motion in his plant and go…competitive blocker and works hard to finish…uses his hands to sustain in pass protection…graduated with a degree in sports administration (December 2018)…team captain with off-the-charts football character…durable, starting all 26 games the last two seasons.","Doesn’t play as fast as he tested…not a deceptive route runner and his patterns lack complexity…limited creator after the catch…his film doesn’t show a sizable catch radius to consistently extend/highpoint…can be blown backward or pinballed off the snap…needs to develop his base technique in pass pro to avoid getting rag-dolled…mediocre career catch production.","A two-year starter at LSU, Moreau lined up across the formation in the Tigers’ pro-style offense, spending most of his time inline and on the wing. He was universally loved by his teammates and coaches for his team-first attitude, earning the No. 18 jersey as a senior, which is awarded to the player who best represents team values. Moreau was underutilized as a pass catcher at LSU, but he showed an ability to cleanly snap routes and adjust to the football when targeted, although he appeared limited after the catch. While assignment sound as a blocker, he tends to lunge and has little margin of error. Overall, Moreau isn’t overpowering and appears indecisive at times as a receiver, but he is a functional positional blocker with the athleticism and ball skills to be a steady downfield option, projecting as a low-ceiling, high-floor backup “Y” tight end.","4th-5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,22,272,12.363636363636363,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,9.625,81.5,4.66,2.72,1.63,36.5,121,4.11,7.16,22

Ranked as the No. 1 tight end and one of the highest-ranked players in the 2016 recruiting class, Nauta initially committed to Florida State before backing out and narrowing his college choice to Alabama, Georgia and Michigan, choosing his home state Bulldogs. His uncle (Joel Smeenge) was a third-round pick (No. 71 overall) in the 1990 NFL Draft, playing 11 seasons at defensive end in the NFL.

Former Georgia offensive coordinator Jim Chaney received criticism in 2017 for underutilizing the tight end position downfield, but it also helped Nauta improve as a run blocker and pass protector, dropping his pads and hips to match the power of defenders. Similar to receivers Riley Ridley and Mecole Hardman, Nauta doesn’t have impressive receiving production, but he took advantage of targets when they were there.

Mack comes from a family of baseball players, including two uncles who played professionally: Shane Mack played 12 MLB seasons and won the 1991 World Series; Quinn Mack spent one season (1994) in the majors. After missing the 2016 season because he was academically ineligible, Mack had an extra year of eligibility but elected to leave school early for the 2019 NFL Draft.

Mack has a unique mix of size, speed and fluidity for the position, flashing the controlled lower body to develop as a route runner and the adjustment skills to play above the rim.

Gentry elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Large target and worked hard to transform his body…soft, natural hands…loose upper body to extend his long arms, adjust and stab…rolls off the line of scrimmage with smooth acceleration into his routes…runs well for the position to threaten the seam…led the team with 11.2 yards per target…doesn’t play stiff at the top of routes, redirecting well out of his breaks…showed steady improvement as a blocker, using lower body bend and length to drive block.","Needs to continue to add bulk…unseasoned route runner and lacks burst in his start/stop movements…doesn’t break tackles in one-on-one situations…not a YAC threat right now…too easily bullied by defensive ends with his tall, narrow base…inconsistent body angles as a blocker…needs to do a better job breaking down in space to engage defenders at the second level or on outside screens…not a proven touchdown producer or red zone threat (of his four career touchdown catches, only two came in the red zone).","A two-year starter at Michigan, Gentry lined up inline and detached in the Wolverines’ pro-style scheme. He was the first quarterback Harbaugh recruited to Michigan and despite never playing another position, the coaches convinced Gentry (after numerous meetings) that the move to tight end would “pay off” in the long run (Michigan TE coach Sherrone Moore: “I think he can be a Pro Bowl NFL player one day if he stays committed to it, which I know he will”). As a pass catcher, he plays like more of a tight end than former life-long quarterback, but he doesn’t play up to his size as a ball carrier or blocker. Overall, Gentry has several tight end foundation traits with his workable frame, natural athleticism and reliable ball skills, but he is underdeveloped as a blocker, route runner and after-the-catch threat, requiring patience while he continues his tight end maturation.","6th-7th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,514,16.0625,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.125,9.5,80.125,4.9,2.86,1.74,29.5,110,4.53,7.4,12

Parham played wideout and pass rusher in 2014, finishing his prep career with only 13 catches for 234 yards and four scores. With not much of a sample size, he wasn’t highly recruited in the 2015 class and signed with FCS-level Stetson in the non-scholarship Pioneer League. Parham’s father (Donald Sr.) and four uncles played college football, including his uncle (Eric Gallon), who played two seasons in the NFL with the New England Patriots; his cousin (Jeremy Gallon) played wide receiver at Michigan and was a seventh-round draft pick in the 2014 NFL Draft. Parham accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Rare height and length for a receiving target…stilts for legs, eating up grass in a hurry…relatively fluid lower body, showing the ability to sink and redirect at the stem…large, accepting hands…casts a wide net with his large wingspan, expanding his catch radius…catches well in stride and quickly resets his vision to change his angles to be a run threat…executed basic blocking assignments in space…production improved each season…his 9.4 catches per game in 2018 was second best in Division I (FBS or FCS) behind only Colorado’s Laviska Shenault.

He finished his career with the school records for catches (180), receiving yards (2,591) and receiving scores (20) – only six times in school history has a player posted 151-plus receiving yards in a game and five belong to Parham. He looked like the FCS version of Hakeem Butler on tape with his size and catch radius, although he faces a sizable jump in competition at the NFL level with legitimate questions how he will adjust to more physical defensive backs. Overall, Parham has only been playing competitive football for five years and requires patience to develop his body and game, but his unique blend of length and athleticism is intriguing, projecting as a hybrid slot weapon with his best football ahead of him.","6th-7th",.,9,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,85,1319,15.51764705882353,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He wasn’t super productive for a player with his number of starts, but he leaves Boston College as one of only seven tight ends to reach the 1,000-yard receiving mark. With an average athletic profile, Sweeney almost always has a defender on his hip, but he catches everything thrown his way with terrific focus and sticky hands away from his frame. While competitive as a blocker, he isn’t powerful and has little margin of error with his fundamentals. Overall, Sweeney is a tough, well-rounded “Y” tight end, but nothing about his game is exceptional, projecting as an NFL reserve who will need to compete for a backup role.","7th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,348,10.875,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.75,9.75,78.375,4.83,2.82,1.68,.,.,.,.,17

While his father was the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State, Wilson attended Starkville High for his freshman and sophomore seasons, throwing for over 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in five games. When his father became Georgia’s defensive line coach in 2013, Wilson transferred to North Oconee High, but missed his junior season due to injury. His father then became the defensive line coach at USC in 2014 and Wilson transferred to Serra High for his senior year, splitting the quarterback duties with Khalil Tate and also seeing snaps at tight end (310 receiving yards, seven touchdowns). He also played basketball at all three high schools. Wilson was ranked as the No. 82 pro-style quarterback in the country and he initially committed to Old Dominion (his only FBS-level offer) as a quarterback before choosing to walk on at USC as a tight end, redshirting in 2015. However, Wilson’s father was fired from the Trojans’ coaching staff after the 2015 season and Wilson elected to transfer because his tuition was no longer paid for as the son of a school employee. He transferred to UCLA and was immediately put on scholarship. His father was a two-time All-American (1990-91) at Oklahoma and was drafted in the 12th round of the 1992 NFL Draft. He most recently spent three seasons (2016-18) as the defensive line coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Wilson elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.

He led all FBS tight ends in 2018 in receptions per game (5.0), receiving yards per game (80.4) and total receiving yards (965). Wilson does a nice job on straight-line patterns, stretching out his stride, but his tight lower body hinders his route running and YAC production. When he is open, he is a steady finisher, but Wilson had a surprising amount of “almost” catches on his tape, struggling to attack with power or consistently make the difficult or contested catch. Overall, Wilson has a productive resume and background, but his tape shows a stiff athlete with inconsistent ball skills and ordinary strength, projecting as a developmental option later in the draft.","PFA",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,60,965,16.083333333333332,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,33,9.75,79.5,4.56,2.69,1.62,29,113,4.4,7.2,.

He was a grad transfer to Oregon for his final season but battled injuries and finished with only eight catches. Despite a lean lower body, Dillon has an NFL frame with a large wingspan, casting a wide net as a pass catcher. He displays galloping speed when he can stretch out his stride, but he needs to better compose his footwork at the top of routes, lacking efficiency in/out of breaks. As a blocker, he gets in the way and flashes a pop at contact but struggles to utilize his length and sustain.

He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Broad-shouldered, big-boned frame with proportionate thickness…wide base and large wingspan…moves well for his size and didn’t lose the corner on tape…balanced in his pass sets with the lateral quickness to lock down inside/outside speed…quick eyes and reaction skills…doesn’t give ground when he stays square…heavy-handed to punch and steer…strong grip to physically move defenders from lanes…looks natural when pulling…mobility to work up a level on combos, using his length to reach linebackers and divert their course…instigator with a nasty streak, blocking through the echo of the whistle…graduated with a degree in criminology (December 2018)…starting experience at tackle and guard.","Disappointing testing numbers…plays upright in his stance with little knee bend…hands stay low and stuck in his holster too long, allowing defenders to strike first…inconsistent punch timing mid-kick slide…forgets his feet at times, relying on his reach…inconsistent body angles and can be caught leaning…athleticism to easily detach in space, but he needs to do a better job keying second-level defenders and handling moving objects…missed almost all of 2016 and a few games in 2017 after breaking the fibula in his left leg (September 2016), requiring surgery.","A three-year starter at Oklahoma, Ford spent two seasons in the left guard rotation before flourishing at right tackle as a junior, lining up primarily in a two-point stance. He was arguably the best player on college football’s best offensive line in 2018, helping the Sooners rank No. 1 in the FBS in total offense (570.3 yards per game) and scoring offense (48.4 points per game). Ford plays tall in his pass sets and often loses the leverage battle, but he has the wide girth and lateral quickness to handle edge speed. He got away with some lazy habits in the Big 12 and needs to improve his technique for the next level, specifically his hand timing in pass protection and body angles as a run blocker. Overall, Ford looks like a grizzly bear with shoulder pads, displaying coordinated feet for his size and the energy and awareness to start at either tackle or guard in the NFL.","1st",19,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,9.75,82.5,5.21,3.02,1.81,28.5,104,4.87,8.27,19

Over his prep career, he helped Allen to a 46-1 record and three straight appearances in the state championship game, winning back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014 with Kyler Murray at quarterback. Little earned First Team All-State honors his junior and senior seasons and was widely considered a top-five recruit and the No. 1 offensive lineman in the 2016 recruiting class. He was committed to Texas A&M for over a year before reopening his recruitment for his senior year and ultimately choosing Ole Miss over Alabama, Auburn and Ohio State. Little’s father (Derrick) played linebacker at South Carolina and was a sixth-round draft pick (154th overall) in 1989 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; he was shot and killed (June 2016) in Dallas. Little elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Wide, athletic base…balanced knee-bender and naturally carries his 310 pounds…lateral movement skills to cut off speed…maintains low pad level to anchor and stymie rushers…outstanding body control from head to toe, allowing him to recover after a false step…relaxed but eager to punch and get his long arms into the frame of rushers…nice job on combinations, working in unison and passing off defenders…gets the job done on down blocks, creating movement with his upper body when he unloads his power…durable and finished his college career with 29 straight starts at left tackle.","Finesse blocker and needs to add more glass to his diet…wild hand placement and timing mid-kick slide…undeveloped counter measures and late to react to pass-rush moves…aggressively overextends himself and loses balance…slow to work around road blocks as a puller…tends to overrun second-level blocks and needs to better break down in space…streaky play from tape to tape, looking like a first-rounder in some games and a fifth-rounder on others.","A three-year starter at Ole Miss, Little started every game for the Rebels since becoming the starting left tackle midway through his freshman season. He checks several boxes for the next level with his ready-made frame, athletic feet and natural bend to redirect through his hips. While he plays controlled in his movements, Little needs time to improve his hand timing and develop more of a killer instinct, playing unsure of himself at times, which leads to mistakes (see 2018 Mississippi State tape). An athletic big man with a relaxed punch and passive tendencies, his film notes read similar to the scouting report of Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley when he was a prospect at Notre Dame. Overall, Little isn’t a seasoned or consistent blocker right now, but he is battle-tested from the SEC and displays the length, awareness and movements to develop into an NFL starter.","1st-2nd",39,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35.25,10.25,85,5.33,3.07,1.82,25,113,4.74,.,.

A standout in basketball and football, he started his junior and senior seasons at tight end and defensive line, finishing his senior season with 76 tackles to earn League Defensive Lineman of the Year honors. McGary was recruited on the offensive and defensive line, although his heart was on defense. He was the No. 2 recruit in the state (behind Budda Baker) and one of the top offensive tackles in the country, considering offers from Washington, Washington State and Wisconsin. Shortly after Chris Petersen was hired as Huskies’ head coach, McGary committed to UW with the promise that he could start his college career on the defensive line, although Petersen saw his future on offense. He spent his redshirt year on the defensive scout team but moved to the offensive line shortly before the 2015 season. McGary accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","NFL frame with athletic muscle tone…quick out of his stance and comfortable on his feet…flexible joints to stay balanced at contact…aggressive handwork and competes with a nasty attitude…efficient on combination blocks and works well in tandem…uses his reach to latch and displace…creates surge as a run blocker to drive defenders wide…mentally and physically tough and accustomed to overcoming adversity…graduated with a degree in communication (December 2018)…durable and started 43 straight games at right tackle.","Top heavy and allows his base to narrow at contact…sub-33-inch arms…wandering punch, exposing his chest and giving up his body…technique breaks down vs. speed, overextending at the waist…marginal balance in a phone booth…needs to better achieve angles in the run game…diagnosed with a heart arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) as a junior in high school, which required three surgeries (not a career-threatening condition but something that requires monitoring)…played only right tackle in college.","A four-year starter at Washington, McGary worked his way into the starting rotation as a freshman and was a mainstay at right tackle for the Huskies ever since, staying on the right side when left tackle Trey Adams was injured. He was the 2018 Morris Trophy winner as the Pac-12’s top offensive lineman (over Washington State’s Andre Dillard), which is voted on by opposing players in the conference. McGary will occasionally labor with wide speed due to average length and feet, but he is a flexible mover and stays balanced in pass protection. Although his bad habits (specifically his tall posture and late hands) lead to mistakes, his tenacious play personality and intangibles help cover up some of his physical deficiencies. Overall, McGary’s on-field reps aren’t always pretty, but they are mostly effective, using his mobility and play strength to tie up edge defenders, projecting as a right tackle (similar to Mitchell Schwartz) ready to compete for immediate starting reps.","2nd-3rd",63,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.875,10.125,79.75,5.05,2.95,1.75,33.5,111,4.58,7.66,23

As a raw 6-2, 225-pound quarterback, he originally committed to South Alabama before a coaching staff change took that option off the table. Howard opted to walk on at FCS-level Alabama State with the intention of transitioning to tight end. During his redshirt year in 2014, he served as the scout team quarterback before the coaches moved Howard to the offensive line where he grew three inches and added nearly 100 pounds over the past four seasons. He                                                                                       played primarily right tackle with a collection of snaps at left tackle and allowed only one sack his senior season, earning FCS All-American honors. Howard accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Athletic frame with long arms…quick-footed in his initial setup to beat rushers to the spot…drops his hips and stays balanced in pass protection…lasts on an island…strong hands (doesn’t wear gloves) and uses his length to engulf rushers…core strength to halt bull rushers, repositioning his hands to steer objects from the pocket…blocks with the “want to” required for the position…flashes violence early…keeps his feet moving once engaged to generate movement in the run game…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…worked hard to add nearly 100 pounds, pushing himself in the weight room (couldn’t bench 225 pounds when he arrived)…has experience at both left and right tackle.","Flat steps in his kick slide…windup motion before his punch, causing him to be late with his hands…inconsistent hand placement and caught hugging with his long arms…bad habit of grabbing when panicked…tends to power down once engaged…still developing his instincts in the trenches and can be late to locate twists and loops…most of his competition came vs. lower level of competition…ran the slowest three-cone at the 2019 scouting combine.","A four-year starter at Alabama State, Howard took an unlikely journey the past five seasons, transitioning from high school quarterback to skinny tight end to offensive tackle with a pro future. Lining up primarily in a two-point stance, he was on the NFL radar last summer but his performance in 2018 (one sack allowed) put him in the conversation to be one of the first non-FBS players drafted, especially after his positive tape vs. Auburn (his favorite team growing up). Howard frustrates defenders with his ability to mirror and uncoil his length to disrupt pass rush plans. While not shy using his hands, he appears clumsy at times because his timing and placement are undeveloped. Overall, Howard is a talented lump of clay with sloppy tendencies, but all the raw tools are there for him to develop into an NFL starter.","3rd",79,10,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,10.625,81.625,5.05,2.97,1.81,29.5,103,4.87,8.34,21

He earned All-Conference honors three straight years and was named All-State as a senior. Playing his senior season at only 250 pounds, Scharping went underrecruited and went overlooked by Wisconsin, where both his parents attended. He was ranked as the No. 20 recruit in Wisconsin and committed to Northern Illinois over Central Michigan, Western Michigan and Yale. Scharping accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Coordinated shuffle in his pass sets…sinks his hips and sits in his stance to handle bull rushers…resets well to stay square…walks the fine line of being patient while also staying aggressive with his punch…grip strength to lock down edge rushers (see 2018 Florida State tape vs. Brian Burns)…rolls his hips and runs his feet to create movement in the run game…comfortable pulling through gaps…quick to set his hands, turn defenders and plant his flag, opening run lanes…sees the field well and understands what the defense is doing…graduated with his undergraduate degree in kinesiology and recently completed his master’s degree (December 2018)…durable and started all 53 games the past four seasons, playing all 998 offensive snaps in 2018.","Inconsistent pass pro depth…only average foot quickness and arm length when protecting the corner…bad habit of bending at the waist to cut off edge speed, falling off balance…tends to be late with his hands, allowing rushers to reach his chest…inefficient on combination blocks with inconsistent results picking up second-level defenders…not a mauler in the run game and hands lack shock…battled through a left hamstring injury during the pre-draft process.","A four-year starter at Northern Illinois, Scharping spent his first two seasons at right tackle and right guard before shifting to left tackle as a junior and senior, lining up primarily in a three-point stance for the Huskies. He graduated with a 3.99 GPA (received one A- in an English class his freshman year) and his high IQ translates well to the football field, sensing pressures and breaking down defenses. Scharping isn’t a top-tier athlete, but he is quick out of his stance and stays busy, allowing only one sack (Iowa’s AJ Epenesa) the last three seasons. His margin for error will be much smaller in the NFL compared to the MAC and he must eliminate bad habits to lock up an NFL starting role. Overall, Scharping has his shortcomings, but he does an excellent job working within the confines of his skill set, displaying a keen understanding of his strengths to mask his weaknesses.","3rd",81,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.625,10,80.125,.,.,.,28,108,4.69,7.77,27

With his basketball background, he plays with long arms, coordinated feet and body movements. Cajuste hasn’t been playing the position most of his life, which shows with his waist-bending pass sets and inconsistent hand play. There are examples on tape of him rolling his hips, using his punch and mirroring rushers in space, but he doesn’t do it on a consistent snap-by-snap basis. Overall, Cajuste has NFL starting potential if he eliminates the sloppy, undisciplined parts to his game, but that is a big “if” and his injury history is a red flag.","3rd-4th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,10,82.25,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32

Evans elected to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Average height but above-average arm length…quick in his setup to achieve initial pass-set landmarks…smartly uses angles to stay square and shield outside run lanes…general understanding of counter measures to react accordingly…it doesn’t always look pretty, but he finishes second-level assignments…generates torque from his lower half, creating movement in the run game…has a nasty streak to him…experienced at left and right tackle with a skill set that should translate well to guard…missed the first game of 2016 and then started 40 straight games to end his collegiate career.","Functional length but soft hands…inconsistent punch placement and his timing must improve to survive in the NFL…tape has too many examples of body-to-body blocks…efficient in his initial slide, but his redirect footwork leaves him tied up, struggling vs. inside moves…can be lulled into relaxing his feet/hands, falling asleep at the wheel…his competitive edge will get the best of him at times, drawing penalties…knee health will be important after tearing his ACL (September 2014) as a high school senior, missing 2015 spring practice with Oklahoma.","A three-year starter at Oklahoma, Evans earned the starting right tackle role as a redshirt freshman, allowing Dru Samia to move inside to guard. He replaced Orlando Brown at left tackle in 2018, lining up mostly in a two-point stance in Lincoln Riley’s offense. Although he needs to improve his footwork in space, Evans has the initial movements to ride speed on the outside. When he stays balanced through contact, he is able to sustain and finish, but it doesn’t happen consistently. Overall, Evans requires more seasoning, both physically and mentally, but his tackle-guard versatility and raw power are plus traits that certain schemes will value more than others, projecting as an NFL backup with starting potential.","4th-5th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.75,9.875,80.5,5.2,3.05,1.85,.,.,.,.,22

He was a three-year starter at North Gwinnett and quickly established himself as one of the top prep linemen in the country. Hyatt was named a U.S. Army All-American and was one of two five-star offensive tackles in the 2015 recruiting cycle. He ranked as the No. 2 recruit in Georgia and No. 23 player in the class. Hyatt received offers from dozens of top programs, but growing up in a family of Clemson fans, there wasn’t much debate where he would sign. His uncle (Dan Benish) was an All-ACC defensive tackle and starter on Clemson’s 1981 national title team.","Coordinated shuffle to stay square to rushers…sets up quickly to maximize body position…leaks outside to occupy linebackers…assignment sound and accomplishes his mission…stubborn at the point of attack, using his grip strength to latch and stay engaged…adequate length…rolls his hips at contact to reinforce his anchor…tough-minded approach was instilled in him at a young age…heightened awareness for the position…team captain and competes with an edge…durable and finished with 57 starts on his collegiate resume.","Folds like a cheap suit once rushers reach his chest…average athleticism…doesn’t play with lower body twitch, struggling to recover vs. shifty rushers…tends to overset, opening inside rush lanes…plays short-armed in his pass sets…needs to eliminate the holding penalties…comes with core strength concerns, allowing rushers to rock him backward…doesn’t have the frame to maul in the run game…bad habit of leaving his feet as a blocker.","A four-year starter at Clemson, Hyatt stepped in as the Tigers’ starting left tackle once Isaiah Battle unexpectedly left the team for the 2015 Supplemental Draft, becoming the first Clemson true freshman to start at tackle since 1944 (Phil Prince). Nicknamed “Mr. Dependable” by head coach Dabo Swinney, he leaves the program with the records for career snaps (3,754) and starts (57), missing only one start the last four seasons because he was late to a meeting. Hyatt is a smart, efficient mover, keeping his feet in sync with his upper body to mirror in his pass sets. He needs technique work to keep rushers from his body, lacking the functional strength to reset his anchor or sustain if his body position isn’t pristine. Overall, Hyatt relies more on angles, spacing and quicks than power and length to get the job done, which will create long-term problems at the next level, projecting as an NFL backup at tackle or guard.","5th",.,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.125,10.25,81.875,.,.,.,25.5,102,4.52,7.72,28

At 6-6 and 240 pounds, he eclipsed 2,000 yards of total offense, while also seeing snaps at defensive end, linebacker and long snapper. Edwards was also a four-year letterman and two-year team captain on the basketball team. His first scholarship offer was from Illinois to play quarterback, but most of his recruiting attention came from programs projecting him at another position. Edwards was the No. 12 recruit in Illinois and committed to Wisconsin over Indiana, Iowa and Vanderbilt. He arrived in Madison as a tight end but moved to offensive tackle during 2016 spring practices. Edwards’ father (David) played football at Indiana; his cousin (Garrett) played safety at Illinois (2006-09). He elected to skip his final season of eligibility at Wisconsin and entered the 2019 NFL Draft.","Steady shuffle out of his stance to widen and hook rushers…quick to extend into defenders and win immediately…large-framed blocker with shock absorbers for hands, slowing power rushers…tends to get off balance in pass pro but understands recovery methods…efficient advancing to the second level…improved awareness and confidence over the last three seasons, reacting well to stunts and blitzes…toughs out injuries.","Not an explosive mover…sloppy in motion, leading to depth issues in his pass sets…habitual leaner, overextending at the waist…chaotic fundamentals and elevated pad level lead to balance issues…struggles to generate power through his legs and hips as a run blocker…needs to develop more of a mean streak…inconsistent finisher and doesn’t always battle through the whistle…medical reports will be important after he suffered nerve damage to his left shoulder (August 2018) in preseason camp, battling the injury throughout the 2018 season (missed three games).","A three-year starter at Wisconsin, Edwards was a high school quarterback and started playing offensive line only three years ago, starting 31 games at right tackle for the Badgers. After an All-American sophomore season, he struggled as a junior in 2018 and NFL teams must determine how much of that was a result of his left shoulder issue. Edwards has adequate movement skills and understands how to keep rushers occupied, but it rarely looks pretty and his technique isn’t ready for NFL pass rushers. As a run blocker, he needs to better roll his hips into his target to drive defenders, doing his best work when his urgency is cranked high. Overall, Edwards has the size, hand strength and enough mobility to play the position in the NFL, but his upper and lower halves speak different languages with only average play strength, projecting as a developmental tackle.","5th",.,10,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.375,9.75,80.125,5.28,3.05,1.79,25.5,99,4.77,7.69,.

Prince was the No. 1 ranked recruit in Maryland and a top-five tackle in the class, initially committing to Alabama.

He had a tumultuous career in Columbus, but showed steady improvement each season (although to be fair, there was nowhere to go but up). Prince is quick out of his stance with enough foot quickness to mirror, but his footwork is too easily tied up with his upper and lower halves on different pages. While he flashes an edge as a physical drive blocker, he doesn’t play with the same confidence in pass pro. Overall, Prince was blessed with outstanding size and raw ability, but his blocks quickly become unglued due to his lack of technique, balance and poise in pass protection, projecting as a traits- only development prospect at right tackle.","5th-6th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35.5,10.125,84.5,5.09,2.94,1.76,27,115,5.02,7.9,23

However, he missed almost all of his junior season in 2011 due to academics. He transferred to Friendship Collegiate for his senior year and (along with Yannick Ngakoue) helped lead the program to the 2012 DCSAA title. Gray was the No. 7 offensive tackle recruit in the 2013 class and a top-100 player overall, committing to nearby Maryland over Florida and Ohio State. However, he didn’t qualify academically and was forced to enroll at Fork Union Military Academy in 2013. Gray again signed with Maryland and joined the program in 2014. He has a 1-year old daughter (Kali).","Naturally wide frame with broad shoulders and long arms…coordinated feet out of his stance and into his shuffle…doesn’t overstep outside, protecting vs. inside moves…comfortable with short pulls and motions…vice grips for hands to shut down defenders once he locks on…flashes the upper body power to quickly recover…relies on calculated angles to wall off defenders…runs his feet as a drive blocker, creating movement…academics were an issue in high school, but he stayed out of trouble growing up, despite negative family influences.","Inconsistent bend and pad level…lack of flexibility in his kick slide leads to balance issues…bad habit of getting over his skis in space, lacking redirect or body control at the second level…inconsistent depth in his pass sets…marginal reaction quickness vs. stunts and twists…unclean punch due to timing issues and wasted motion…was a left tackle only in college…older prospect and was part of the same high school graduating class as Ngakoue, who is entering his fourth NFL season…medicals need to check out, missing two games as a senior due to injuries; underwent offseason knee surgery (February 2018); underwent left shoulder surgery (April 2015) to repair a torn labrum.","A two-year starter at Maryland, Gray was the starting left tackle in the Terrapins’ motion-heavy offense under Matt Canada in 2018 and wasn’t asked to routinely pass protect in Maryland’s run-first scheme. He isn’t the loudest but carried himself like a “veteran leader,” according to his teammates. Gray is average from an athletic standpoint and lacks quick reflexes to match shifty edge rushers. However, he understands how to maximize his natural size and length and flashes violence in his hands to thud defenders when he correctly times his punch. Overall, Gray is a heavy athlete and struggles with balance issues on the move, but he stays engaged with rushers and can be a mauler in the run game, projecting as a backup swing tackle who will fight for starting reps.","6th",.,10,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34.375,9.625,81.625,5.26,3.07,1.84,.,90,.,.,26

Udoh didn’t receive any FBS-level offers and he committed to FCS-level Elon over North Carolina A&T, North Carolina Central and William & Mary. His younger sister (Ona) is currently a starter on the Wake Forest women’s basketball team. Udoh accepted his invitation to the East-West Shrine Game and stayed committed after his Senior Bowl invite arrived, playing in both all-star games.","Massive blocker with long arms and large hands…engulfs rushers with his huge wingspan…opens his hips and uses his wide base to gain ground laterally in his pass sets…able to block low to high out of his stance, despite tall pads…stays balanced at contact and won’t be moved from his spot…uses his length to redirect defenders once he locks on…unloads as a drive blocker, clearing run lanes…graduated with a degree in exercise science (December 2018) and hopes to one day follow in the medical footsteps of his father, who runs his own practice…durable and started 45 straight games.","Waist-bender and lacks ideal lower body bend…consistently the tallest pads in the trenches…sluggish puller with inconsistent angles…needs to speed up his process, allowing rushers into his body…needs to load more ammo into his hands…wish he played with more of a killer instinct as a finisher…weight ballooned to 385 pounds in college and his conditioning/nutrition will be critical for an NFL future…only college reps came at right tackle, lacking experience inside at guard.","A four-year starter at Elon, Udoh held up well in the Phoenix’s no-huddle, up-tempo offense, starting every game at right tackle the last four seasons. He is attempting to be the first Elon player to be drafted in the top six rounds since 1984. Udoh sets well off the snap and uses his wide frame to slow edge rushers, but speed will give him trouble at the top of the rush. Although he flashes core power, he lacks heavy pop in his punch and would benefit from more glass in his diet.

Hitner received attention from FBS-level teams but the offers never arrived, sticking to his commitment to nearby Villanova. At only 255 pounds, he redshirted in 2014 and saw little playing time the next two seasons before earning a starting role at right tackle for his junior and senior years.

Hitner has terrific movement skills to quickly achieve his angles, but the athletic traits don’t always manifest on the field due to mechanical issues. Some teams are evaluating him as a center, while others see him as a guard (position he played in high school) and others think he has the agility to stay at tackle.

He uses short, choppy steps to tie up rushers, but struggles to bend his knees, drop his hips and get his hands involved on time. His patchy technique leads to anchor issues and forces him to lean into blocks, finding himself habitually off-balance. Overall, Okeke has intriguing physical gifts, but he is mechanically and mentally undeveloped and faces an uphill climb as he continues to play catchup on the football field.","PFA",.,9,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

After a torn ACL late in the 2015 season (Nov. 2015), he missed the first month of the 2016 season, starting the final seven games at left tackle. He missed the first three games in 2018 due to injury, starting the final eight games and garnering All-American honors. Fineanganofo is well put together and uses his length to lock out, slow rushers and maintain spacing. He is active with his hands but tends to labor in his kick slide due to flexibility issues. In the run game, he struggles to sustain due to issues related to his leverage and body position. Overall, Fineanganofo needs considerable technique work as both as a pass protector and run blocker, but his traits are worth developing on the practice squad.","PFA",.,8,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Over his first few years in Fayetteville, he struggled to break into the starting lineup and was more of a fallback option, but he put together a more consistent season as a senior, starting all 12 games. Wallace has controlled feet pre-contact and is quick to achieve his landmarks and utilize body angles. He keeps his head on a swivel to pick up extra rushers, but he frequently loses balance at contact, allowing his upper body to extend past his feet. He hurts his ability to sustain when he sets high and abandons his leverage, lacking the hand placement or tempo to recover. Overall, Wallace has the necessary skills to be a developmental tackle/guard, but he won’t make it unless he improves his base strength and posture in pass pro.","PFA",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Despite weighing only 235 pounds as a senior, Lindstrom earned All-State honors in 2014 and was ranked as a top-five recruit in Massachusetts. He received only two FBS-level offers, committing to nearby Boston College over Old Dominion and enrolling early. Lindstrom’s father (Chris Sr.) was a Hall of Fame offensive lineman at Boston University, played three seasons in the NFL and was the head coach at Shepherd Hill for 16 seasons (2001-16); Lindstrom’s younger brother (Alec) is a redshirt sophomore offensive lineman at Boston College.

Risner played center his entire life before moving to left tackle as a senior at Wiggins but missed almost all of the 2013 season with an injury. He was considered a top-five recruit in Colorado and committed to Kansas State over Arizona State, Colorado State and Missouri. After earning Freshman All-American honors at center in 2015, Risner was moved to right tackle for his final three seasons.

Position flexibility is key to his evaluation (similar to Austin Corbett in the 2018 NFL Draft class), taking practice reps at guard and serving as the backup center (took practice snaps pre-game) while at right tackle. Risner is smart and plays with outstanding awareness to decipher all the moving parts around him. Although he is consistently in the right position on tape, which helps him combat speed and long-armed defenders, his technical flaws and lower body stiffness will be tougher to mask vs. NFL rushers. Overall, Risner has athletic limitations, but he should carve out a long NFL career due to his intangibles, toughness and versatility in the NFL, projecting best at guard.","2nd",46,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,10.25,81.125,5.3,3.1,1.86,28.5,110,4.52,7.69,23

He also participated in track and field at San Ramon Valley, performing the discus and shot put. Samia, who is half-Samoan (on his father’s side), played on both sides of the line, earning All-League honors as an offensive tackle his junior and senior seasons. He ranked as the No. 30 offensive tackle recruit in the country and received over a dozen scholarship offers before narrowing his list to Oklahoma and UCLA, choosing the Sooners.

Samia boasts the upper body torque to displace defenders while staying balanced with coordinated steps. His taller play style works against him at times, but he does a nice job rolling his hips into contact and introducing his hands.

Davis was ranked as the No. 127 guard recruit in the country and committed to Charlotte over Old Dominion and Toledo. An upstart program, he was part of the 49ers’ third-ever recruiting class. The reason he chose Charlotte is the “father-son” relationship he developed with assistant coach Phil Ratliff, who died in August 2015 from a cardiac event. Davis accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Light-footed athlete…flexible lower body to maintain a wide base…sits low in his stance with his butt 12 inches off the ground…stays underneath blocks to leverage defenders and create movement…patient in his setup and shuffle…physical hands to extend and meet defenders…stout anchor to slow bull rushers at shallow depth…grinder in the run game and always looking for a warm body to block…type of blocker who looks in his element as a puller, taking joy in showing off his athleticism in space…starting experience at tackle and guard.","Needs to shed some bad weight…tends to overset, falling off balance when his feet widen…bad habit of overextending, ending up on the ground…late replacing his hands vs. quick-footed linemen…not an overpowering run blocker who will create immediate knock-back…needs to introduce more angles to be a better sustain blocker…suspended the first four games of 2018 for an NCAA rules violation.","A four-year starter at Charlotte, Davis earned a starting role at as a freshman, starting at right guard his first three seasons before kicking out to right tackle as a senior. He was surprisingly nimble outside at tackle and did an excellent job protecting the edge, but his skill set and size measurements project him best inside in the NFL. Davis has the footwork and flexibility reminiscent of New England Patriots’ Shaq Mason when he was coming out of Georgia Tech. He does an excellent job playing low in his stance to anchor, but there are areas of his game, specifically his lower body balance, that need to be cleaned up before facing NFL competition.

He was ranked as the No. 14 offensive tackle recruit in the country and a top-three recruit in the state. Michigan was his first substantial offer, but growing up just outside of Cincinnati, Jordan was an Ohio State fan and chose the Buckeyes shortly after they offered him, enrolling early.

He is one of only six true freshmen to start a season opener at Ohio State and the first offensive lineman to do it since Orlando Pace in 1994. Jordan needs to add strength and refine the technical aspects of his game, but his movement skills and flexibility are his best assets. While he is clearly more comfortable at guard, a full season of experience at center should only boost his chances of finding success as a pro.

Although he is well-versed at multiple positions, Deiter is more powerful than explosive and is better in a phone booth than in space, projecting best as an interior player at the next level. He has the intelligence and competitive resiliency that teams covet on the offensive line. Overall, Deiter must improve his footwork in pass protection to lock down a starting role in the NFL, but he is a masher in the run game with the collegiate resume and position flex that will draw patience from teams.","4th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.125,10.75,78.625,5.23,3.04,1.81,28,105,4.81,7.88,21

Jones plays with bounce in his feet as a pass protector and shows the ability to stretch front side on outside zone runs. While athletic on the move, he needs to improve his coordination, unlock his power and quicken his punch, especially if he moves inside.

Froholdt returned to Denmark for his junior year (foreign exchange students can only spend one season overseas) and played with a professional club team (Gold Diggers) in 2013. He returned to the states for his senior season and enrolled at IMG Academy in Florida, moving inside to defensive tackle. Froholdt was the No. 15 defensive tackle recruit in the 2015 class and a top-10 player from Florida, receiving offers from Alabama, Ohio State and several other top programs. However, Arkansas was one of the first schools to recruit him and he fell in love with the campus. Froholdt moved to the offensive line prior to his sophomore season.

Tate helped lead the team to a combined 24-3 record his junior and senior seasons, including a 2014 District Championship. Tate ranked as the No. 86 guard in the 2014 recruiting class, signing with Memphis. He started his career at right tackle before moving to left tackle for his final three seasons. Tate accepted his invitation to the 2019 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.","Initial quickness to cut off edge rushers…keeps his feet underneath him and his upper and lower halves in sync…natural body control and stays balanced on the move…combative and usually wins body position…rolls his hips to engage and stays balanced through contact…runs his feet to create movement in the run game…turns defenders to seal outside run lanes…mean dude and finishes his blocks…graduated with a degree in sport management (December 2018)…extensive starting experience (47 career starts) with playing time at left and right tackle.","Undersized and lacks ideal height and length for the edges…lacks the core power to bully defenders from the spot…needs to use better knee bend to strengthen his anchor, struggling to slow down power rushers…efficient puller but needs to improve his coordination vs. moving targets…occasionally late out of his stance, giving up the corner…character requires extensive vetting: pulled over for going 89 MPH in a 40 MPH zone (September 2016), which led to a warrant check and the discovery that he was wanted for a probation violation for felony theft charge in Texas.","A four-year starter at Memphis, Tate started at right tackle as a freshman before moving to left tackle as a sophomore and starting the last 39 games. Despite past questions about his character, he was named a senior captain and was a critical piece of an offensive line that averaged 523.1 total yards per game in 2018. The Memphis offense utilizes a lot of motion and requires linemen to play on their feet, allowing Tate to show off his agile lower body and lateral quickness to slide with rushers. He uses natural leverage and body position to sustain, but he lacks ideal anchor strength and struggles to create torque as a finisher. Overall, Tate is a classic tackle-guard tweener, lacking the size/length for tackle and the brute power at guard, but he doesn’t labor in his movements and can handle zone- blocking responsibilities, projecting as an NFL backup at guard.","5th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32.375,9.625,77,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,22

Lining up primarily as a tight end and defensive end, he collected 60 tackles, 12 tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks as a senior, adding 13 catches for 203 yards and three scores on offense. Benzschawel also saw snaps as an offensive lineman and earned 2013 First Team All-State honors. He was rated as the No. 11 recruit in Wisconsin and initially committed to Syracuse. However, once his “dream school” Wisconsin extended a scholarship offer, he quickly flipped and committed as a “big athlete.” He is a legacy at Wisconsin: his father (Scott) played nose guard (1983-87); his uncle (Eric) played football (1988-92); his grandfather (John Morgen) competed in rowing (1955-57); his younger brother (Luke) is a rising junior tight end for the Badgers; another younger brother (JP) is committed to Wisconsin in the 2021 recruiting class. Benzschawel accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Large-framed mover with adequate length…agile in short spaces…comfortable pulling and locating moving targets…physical hands and delivers a stiff punch when his timing is right…pays attention to his technique…works hard to sit in his stance and not allow his pad level to be a detriment…heightened awareness and understands protections…has some experience at tackle…durable and only the fourth offensive lineman in school history with at least 49 career starts.","Can be jostled off balance by speed-to-power rushers…anchor strength appears to come and go…pads rise as the play progresses…tends to overextend with inconsistent hand placement, hurting his sustain skills…not a brawler with only average strength throughout his core…needs to better shift his weight and mirror once engaged…streaky results when climbing to the second level.","A four-year starter at Wisconsin, Benzschawel made offensive line his full-time focus once he arrived in Madison and started 49 straight games, including every game at right guard the last three seasons. He is a third-generation Badger and only the third offensive lineman in school history to repeat as a First Team All- American (first since Joe Thomas). Benzschawel has controlled footwork out of his stance with natural knee bend to achieve his landmarks. Despite his ability to play low, his taller posture catches up with him at times, struggling with his contact balance vs. power. Overall, Benzschawel is more of a stalemate player than consistent point-of-attack winner, but he is a smart, technically driven blocker with the short-area quicks to push for NFL starting reps at guard.","5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.375,9.625,79.625,5.24,3.05,1.85,.,.,.,.,20

Despite zero experience, he also joined the wrestling team his junior year, going 17-17 his first season and 34-3 as a senior, losing in overtime in the state finals. Powers didn’t receive any scholarship offers from FBS or FCS programs after high school and wasn’t ranked among recruiting services. His best offer was from Division II Pittsburg State, which offered a 75 percent scholarship, but Powers wanted to play at a high level to better his chances of playing on Sundays. He went the JUCO route and enrolled at Butler Community College for the 2015 season. Powers earned All-Conference honors and several Big 12 offers as a three-star JUCO recruit, committing to Oklahoma over TCU (only needed one year at the JUCO level because he was a full qualifier out of high school). His grandfather (Bob) played basketball for Wichita State in the 1965 Final Four. All eight of Bob’s children played collegiate sports after Kapaun Mt. Caramel, including Ben’s father (Todd), who played college basketball at Friends University. Powers accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Adequate movement up/down the line of scrimmage…understands how to maximize blocking angles…keeps his head on a swivel to put himself in the best position to win matchups…strong grip once he locks on…resets his anchor well to slow bull rushers…highly competitive on-field demeanor and plays with an attitude (Powers: “I love taking a grown man’s dreams and crushing him”)…has starting experience at both left and right guard.","Top heavy and carries most of his weight in his upper half…arms don’t play as long as they measured…lacks pop in his hands to create immediate knock back or drive defenders…pads rise quickly at contact, negating his leverage…grabby when the defender gains an inch, leading to holding calls…marginal recovery quickness…inconsistent balance at the second level…limited workouts during the pre-draft process due to a left hamstring injury (February 2019).","A three-year starter at Oklahoma, Powers was pressed into action as a sophomore due to injuries and started 35 games the last three seasons, earning All-American honors as a senior. He is a self-made player, betting on himself out of high school and going from zero FBS scholarship or walk-on offers to starting at Oklahoma within two years. Powers has ordinary athletic traits but he stays on his feet and displays outstanding awareness. He competes with a physical edge and consistently affects the game with his effort and bulldog mentality.

On the football field, he played both ways and earned All-Division honors his junior and senior seasons. Miles wasn’t nationally ranked as a recruit and talked with FCS-level teams like North Carolina A&T and Towson before committing to Morgan State. He was entrenched as the starting left tackle but missed the 2017 season due to academics (not enough credits). Miles accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Well-constructed frame with proportionate bulk…remarkable arm length and not shy meeting rushers before they can attack his body…moves with bounce in his lower body…looks comfortable in space and stays balanced in his pass sets…wide base and rolls his hips into contact…occasionally flashes violence in his hands…voted a senior captain…missed the 2017 season due to academics, but he posted 3.0-plus GPA the following semesters and his coaches call him driven…offers positional flexibility.","His feet lose life at contact in pass protection…plays too high in his redirect, struggling to quickly recover (inside moves eat him up)…needs to improve his pre-snap reads and anticipation…inconsistent blocking angles, especially at the top of the rush or at the second level…eager to use his length but doesn’t have a thudding punch and his placement is sporadic…aggressiveness tends to come and go, especially in the run game…lacks experience vs. top-tier competition.","A three-year starter at Morgan State, Miles lined up in both a two-point and three-point stance at left tackle in the Bears’ shotgun, read-option offense. After sitting out the 2017 season due to academics, he showed added motivation as a senior and put himself on the NFL radar, allowing only one sack (North Carolina A&T’s Daryl Johnson) all season. He is attempting to be the second draft pick from Morgan State since 1982 (tight end Visanthe Shiancoe in 2003). A late bloomer, Miles isn’t a fundamentally sound blocker right now, but he understands the basics and looks to get his impressive arm length involved. Although his tape is at tackle,                                                                                     [98]  he did a nice job at guard during East-West Shrine practices and a move inside should accelerate his development. Overall, Miles’ awareness and mechanics are still at a basement level, but he is an intriguing traits prospect with his size, length and athletic feet, projecting as a draftable project at either tackle or guard.","6th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35.625,10.75,84.875,5.32,3.08,1.84,36,109,4.75,8.07,.

He played on the defensive line as a freshman at Hamilton before moving to the offensive line for his final three years of high school (mainly at tackle, but he also saw reps at center and guard). He wrestled as a freshman but that was the only other sport he played in high school. He was only 230 pounds as a senior and didn’t have the grades to qualify, leading him to Glendale Community College for the 2014 season. He transferred to Mesa Community College for two years but sat out the 2015 season to focus on academics and to take care of his mother, who was diagnosed with cancer (she’s now cancer free but is dealing with other ailments). He practiced at defensive end during summer and fall practices, but when a starting offensive lineman was hurt in the 2016 opener, the coaches asked Tucker to move back to offense and he started the rest of the season at tackle. For his final two seasons of eligibility, he committed to FCS-level Southern Utah (his first offer) over Northern Arizona and Southeast Missouri State. Tucker played primarily at tackle (right side in 2017 and left side in 2018) but filled in at left guard in the final three games of 2018 due to injury. His father (Mark) was an offensive lineman at USC and seventh-round pick (No. 186 overall) of the Atlanta Falcons in the 1991 NFL Draft, playing six seasons in the NFL and 10 seasons in the Arena Football League. Tucker accepted his invitation to the 2019 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.","Quick-footed athlete with natural body control…sudden out of his stance…flexible hips to redirect vs. inside moves…appropriately sorts to make clean adjustments to heavy pressures…stays balanced through contact in pass protection…thick legs and a workable frame, adding 70-plus pounds since high school…physical hands and routinely finishes defenders to the ground on tape…keeps busy and flips a switch on the field…works hard to stay committed to his technique and not freelance…starting experience at tackle (left and right) and guard.","Starts tall with an upright stance and little knee bend…gets his upper half overextended and can be turned from the hole…long-armed linemen will get inside his chest, lacking ideal arm length to respond…pass-set angles aren’t currently a strength to his game…gets too much cloth in his grip and needs to avoid holding calls…battles with asthma, although it hasn’t kept him from playing (Tucker: “If I feel like it’s acting up, I’ll get two puffs on my inhaler and I’m fine”)…has three starts vs. FBS teams (Oregon, Oregon State and Arizona), but doesn’t have a large sample size vs. top-tier competition.","A two-year starter at Southern Utah, Tucker moved from right tackle to left tackle as a senior for the Thunderbirds, also seeing time at guard. He was only 260 pounds when he arrived at SUU from the JUCO level, developing his body and mind the last two seasons. Despite playing at the FCS-level, Tucker’s positive 2018 tapes vs. Pac-12 teams Arizona (his home state) and Oregon State are what attracted scouts to his potential. Not only does he show the foot quickness and toughness required for the NFL, but his cerebral approach, dog mentality and football IQ have shown gradual improvement. Overall, Tucker needs continued work with his technique and point-of-attack anchor, but his best NFL position will be inside at guard or center due to his setup/attack quickness to answer interior rushers.","6th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Playing at a low classification, Calhoun went underrecruited and appeared headed for Southern Miss until Mississippi State offered, becoming the first (and only) player from Restoration to sign a Division I scholarship. He has a 2-year old daughter (Ivy). Calhoun accepted his invitation to the 2019 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.","Maintains low pads off the snap to stay underneath defenders…bends well at his knees to anchor at the point of attack…large hands with decent strength behind them…strong-willed blocker and can move defenders from the hole…works to achieve body position and wall off lanes…graduated with a degree in Industrial Technology (December 2018)…blocks with a combative mentality…started every game the last two seasons.","Average body type…not an overpowering player and won’t jolt defenders…wild hands and lacks control in his initial setup and reach…mistimes his punch, allowing quickness to cross his face or attack his gap…bad habit of lunging with his upper half…makes too much contact with his own blockers and needs to play more graceful in his movements…not a rangy player and most comfortable in confined quarters…played only right guard in college…missed four games as a sophomore due to a left ankle sprain (October 2016), requiring surgery after the season.","A three-year starter at Mississippi State, Calhoun earned the starting right guard job as a sophomore and didn’t give up his post the last three seasons.

Calhoun has the length to get away with undisciplined hands and mistimed punch in college, but that won’t be the case in the NFL. Although he isn’t an overwhelming blocker, Calhoun keeps busy through the whistle to create stalemates, competing with the same toughness regardless of the scoreboard. Overall, Calhoun tends to get sloppy and is often late off the snap, but once he finds his footing, he is a stubborn positional blocker who keeps defenders occupied, projecting as a potential NFL backup.","6th-7th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.125,10,78.25,5.07,2.89,1.72,28.5,105,4.62,7.46,26

After initially committing to Stanford, he backed off and considered Arizona State, Washington and others before recommitting to Stanford before signing day. His father (Bruce) played football and basketball at Lewis and Clark. Herbig decided to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft, sitting out the bowl game.","Looks the part with a wide, filled-out body…brute power in his upper half to displace bodies when he wants to…physical finisher who secures down blocks…strong hands to control the man in front of him…wide vision with the awareness to find extra pressures…adequate job finding his landmarks in pass protection…versatile starting experience, playing at both guard spots and outside at right tackle.","Poor athlete with heavy feet…doesn’t move with any explosion, struggling to surge or shuffle laterally…inconsistent base strength and needs to play with better sink…mistimes his punch and needs to shoot his hands quicker…caught bending at the waist, overextending himself…late to react to counters and allows rushers into his body…not a consistent climber and struggles to pick off second-level defenders…flashes a mean streak but it’s selective and doesn’t show on every play…missed five games as a senior due to injury.","A three-year starter at Stanford, Herbig became the first Cardinal true freshman to start on the offensive line since 2012 (second since 2000) and filled in at left guard, right guard and right tackle over his career. He entered the 2018 season with plenty of hype but missed the second half of the season due to injury and surprised many when he elected to leave school early. Herbig is a phone-booth brawler who can create run lanes and should get better once he improves his hand timing and balance at the point of attack. He likes to slow play blocks before going for the kill shot but it often leads to him overextending and ending up on the ground. Overall, Herbig is a massive blocker who wins in small areas, but his suspect athleticism, contact balance and anchor strength are concerns for the NFL jump, projecting as a developmental prospect in a power scheme.","6th-7th",.,7,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.25,10.125,78,5.41,3.14,1.85,24,90,5.04,8.15,29

He started all 14 games at left tackle for the Longhorns in 2018, finishing his collegiate career with 50 starts. Anderson is a loose-jointed blocker who recognizes things quickly to get a head start with his movements. However, he labors in space and loses control, bending at the waist and getting his head over his skis. His misjudged body angles and late hands also hurt his effectiveness on tape, which shows in pass protection and as a run blocker.

The Aggies’ coaches named Sutherland the most improved lineman after his senior season, showing better technique and tenacity in his final collegiate season. He is a short-armed blocker and is too easily countered by rushers, but his heavy hands will control defenders if he wins early in the rep. He has agile feet to advance to the second level, breaking down to engage linebackers and drive them from run lanes (showed this vs. LSU’s Devin White). Overall, Sutherland is an upright blocker and hip tightness will leave him off-balance, but his adequate feet and grip strength will give him a chance.","PFA",.,12,10,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He saw immediate snaps at guard and earned starts at all three interior positions over his collegiate career, starting all 36 games the last three seasons. Patterson has balanced thickness but shorter arms, which limits his ability to reach, stun or control defenders at the point of attack. He sets up quickly with bounce in his feet to pull, trap or adjust to rushers, but he must implement better use of body angles in his reset. As a run blocker, the effort is there, but he isn’t a mauler who will easily bulldoze bodies from lanes.

He started at right guard and center as a junior before having his breakout season as a senior right guard, earning several All-American nods. Stallings needs to improve his punch timing in pass pro, but he is quick to drop his hips and anchor. In the run game, he shows off his tenacious temperament, stubbornly staying attached to defenders and burying to the ground (emotional play will sometimes backfire and get the best of him). He has football bloodlines with his father (Robert) and older brother (Tre) playing collegiately before short stints in the NFL.

He bounced between center and left guard his first two years before moving to right tackle as a junior, returning to left guard for his final season in 2018. Bailey suffered a broken left fibula in the regular-season finale, missing the bowl game and East-West Shrine Game. He has adequate quickness and footwork in his setup, but he is tightly wound with suspect contact balance, lacking the ammo in his punch/recoil to recover.

Bushell-Beatty is top- heavy and plays tall, but he uses his upper body strength to win the point of attack and drive defenders in the run game. While he works hard to find his landmarks and wall off the pocket, he lacks the lateral quickness in his slide to mirror and match athletic rushers, laboring to redirect vs. inside moves.

He was a tight end and defensive end in high school and helped lead his team to back-to-back state championships in 2012 and 2013. As a senior, Bradbury finished with 17 catches for 360 yards and six scores, adding 13.0 tackles for loss and 5.0 sacks on defense. He was ranked the No. 72 tight end in the country and didn’t crack the top-50 recruits in the state, receiving offers from Charlotte, Colorado State and NC State (his lone offer from a Power Five program). Bradbury signed as a tight end and started his collegiate career there before moving to the defensive line and eventually the offensive line during the 2015 season (he rebuked the move, but the coaches forced it). His father (Tim) played tight end at Eastern Washington (where he was roommates with former Florida head coach Jim McElwain). Bradbury accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Fluid snap and step action and immediately finds his balance…flies out of his stance to reach the defensive tackle and cut off gap penetrators…agile footed and easily advances to the second level to remove linebackers from the play…quick to turn and seal run lanes…nice job replacing his large hands to tie up interior rushers…three-time Academic All-ACC honoree and that intelligence translates to the field, displaying excellent field vision and anticipation…called a “student of the game” by his coaches…added 50-plus pounds since high school and known as a relentless worker in the weight room…voted a senior captain…graduated with a degree in operations management (December 2017)…starting experience at guard and notched 900-plus snaps each of the last two seasons at center.","Doesn’t have ideal length and will be caught grabbing…lacks ideal sand in his pants and power/momentum will bully him backward on his heels…not a road grader in the run game and might not fit every scheme…missed 2015 spring due to shoulder surgery.","A three-year starter at NC State, Bradbury replaced Joe Thuney at left guard in 2016 before moving to center for his junior and senior seasons, not allowing a sack the last two years. A high school tight end, he balked at programs who recruited him as a lineman and while NC State initially allowed him to stay at tight end, the coaches eventually forced the move – and five years later, he is the top center in the 2019 NFL Draft. Bradbury has outstanding athleticism and mobility for the position with the alert awareness required to lead an offense. He can be knocked off balance at times, but he is quick to recover and understands the biomechanics of the position. Overall, Bradbury will have the occasional trouble vs. power, but he is exceptionally quick, instinctive and tough, ideally suited for a zone-blocking scheme in the NFL where he has Pro Bowl potential.","1st",17,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,31.75,10.5,76.5,4.92,2.84,1.69,31,104,4.53,7.41,34

He received offers from Houston, Kansas and Oklahoma State, but once Texas A&M offered (24 hours after his final high school game), he quickly committed. McCoy elected to skip his senior season and accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Quick out of his stance to cover up defenders…mobility as an outside puller to cut off pursuit angles…stays balanced mid-shuffle with a relaxed punch…displays the technical savvy to tie up his target…sinks his hips to neutralize power…vigilant blocker with developed instincts…competes with a quiet intensity and win-at-all-cost demeanor…puts in the time off the field and his coaches praise his work habits…voted a 2018 team captain…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…started every game the past three seasons with experience at center and guard.","Doesn’t play explosive…has some lower body stiffness, which hurts his reset ability…struggles to slow cross-face rushers…doesn’t have a heavy punch to create knock-back at contact…only 33-inch arms and long-armed defenders can get into his frame…erratic hand placement…overextends himself at the second level…improved snap accuracy, but his inaccurate snaps came when nose to nose with a defensive tackle.","A three-year starter at Texas A&M, McCoy earned a starting role as a redshirt freshman and quickly established himself as the glue of the Aggies’ offensive line. He had his ups and downs against top-tier teams, but he battled and held up better than most against elite competition like Alabama’s Quinnen Williams, Clemson’s Dexter Lawrence and Mississippi State’s Jeffrey Simmons. He is very balanced in his movements and efficiently breaks down all the moving parts in front of him, keeping his lower and upper halves on the same page. He will occasionally get burned by quickness or power, but you rarely see him make mental mistakes.

McGovern loads his hands and runs his feet in the run game, locating his targets from distance with excellent awareness.

Gaillard, who also did the shot put and discus for the track team, was a substantial part of Pine Forest growing from a 1-10 team in 2011 to 10-2 in 2013. He was the No. 10 defensive tackle recruit in the country and held offers from top programs like Alabama, Florida and Notre Dame, but he narrowed his list to Clemson and Georgia, choosing to follow in the footsteps of other North Carolina natives like Todd Gurley to Athens.

He was ranked as the No. 1 pass rush recruit in the country with offers from every major program, but he grew up an Ohio State fan (where his mother, Cheryl, went to school). Bosa comes from a football family: his father (John) was a first-round defensive end out of Boston College in the 1987 NFL Draft (No. 16 overall) and played three years for the Miami Dolphins; his maternal uncle (Erik Kumerow) was an Ohio State captain in 1987 and a first-round defensive end in the 1988 NFL Draft (No. 16 overall), playing three years for the Dolphins; his older brother (Joey) was a first-round defensive end out of Ohio State in the 2016 NFL Draft (No. 3 overall) and currently plays for the Los Angeles Chargers. Nick Bosa missed most of the 2018 season due to injury and left school early for the 2019 NFL Draft.","Launches low and balanced out of his stance…gains considerable ground with first step, immediately putting blockers on their heels…enough bend to run the hoop…coordinated weight transfer with his loose hips and lateral quicks…diverse, well-timed hand tactics…aggressive rush attack, but more importantly there is nuance to his hand sequence…outstanding play violence to work his way through bodies…heavy hands to stack and set the edge vs. power…matured, limber body type…tough-minded and has no trouble doing the dirty work…close-knit football bloodlines and an NFL locker room will be a natural fit for his personality…productive when on the field with 29.0 tackles for loss and 17.5 sacks in 30 career games.","Prefers to use forward lean mid-rush, occasionally ending up on the ground…lacks sudden redirection skills outside of his pass rush and can be a tick late reacting to backfield misdirection…doesn’t have the core strength to bully in the run game and tight ends can catch him off-guard, putting him on his back…troubling injury history as he tried to push through groin and abdomen issues during the first three games of 2018 before re-aggravating those injuries vs. TCU (September 2018), requiring season-ending bilateral abdominal surgery; he suffered a “slight ACL tear” in his right knee (November 2015) as a senior in high school and required surgery, which prematurely ended his high school career; the injury history of his father and older brother will be weighed differently by each club.","A two-year starter at Ohio State, Bosa rushed off the left and right edges in the Buckeyes’ four-man front where he was coached by revered defensive line coach Larry Johnson. After an All-American sophomore season, he entered the 2018 season as the No. 1 draft-eligible player in college football, but underwent surgery in September for his groin and abdominal injury (he was expected to recover by early December, but elected to leave the team and work toward the NFL). Durability is the main concern for his NFL projection, but when on the field, Bosa uses proper biomechanics to maximize his body force and convert speed-to-power as a rusher. The opportunity to watch and learn from his Pro Bowl older brother accelerated his development, both showing the same appreciation for the art of the pass rush. Overall, Bosa is a carbon copy of Joey Bosa with his blend of athleticism and violent hands, gaining ground and defeating blocks in a variety of ways to make an impact rushing the passer and stopping the run.","1st",1,3,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,14,6,4,1,0,0,33,10.75,77.875,4.79,2.76,1.62,33.5,116,4.14,7.1,29
"JOSH ALLEN","EDGE","Kentucky",41,"7/13/1997","21.80","SR",76.875,"262","Montclair, N.J.","Montclair","A two-star linebacker recruit out of high school, Joshua “Josh” Allen grew up in New Jersey, but crowded living conditions at home and the desire for a fresh start (diagnosed with ADHD) led him to Alabama after middle school, moving in with his aunt and uncle. He preferred basketball, but also tried out for football at Abbeville High School, developing into a First Team All-State wide receiver as a junior with 1,150 yards and 11 touchdowns. With his sisters leaving home for college, Allen returned to Montclair for his senior year where he transitioned to defense, also seeing snaps at wide receiver. He helped lead Montclair to an undefeated 2014 season, including a third-straight state title, finishing his senior year with a state-best 22.5 sacks. With the move to New Jersey and the transition to defensive end, Allen fell through the cracks as a college recruit. His only FBS scholarship offer was from Buffalo, but he committed to FCS-level Monmouth due to its proximity. In the final days prior to signing day, Kentucky had a few decommitments and thanks to persistence from his high school head coach (John Fiore), Kentucky visited Montclair as they were scrambling to fill out their recruiting class. They offered him on the spot and Allen visited campus the next day, committing to the Wildcats. Allen is one of six kids, including his fraternal twin brother (Isaiah). His older sister (Myisha Hines-Allen) played basketball at Louisville and currently plays for the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. His older sister (LaTorri Hines-Allen) played basketball at Virginia Tech. His uncle (Gregory Hines) was a standout basketball player at Hampton (1979-83) before he was a fifth-round pick in the 1983 NBA Draft, playing 12 years in various professional leagues. Allen has a one-year old son (Wesley) with his girlfriend. He originally accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but later pulled out of the event.","Excellent first step to win the corner with a simple speed rush…expanded his pass rush repertoire each season at Kentucky…long-armed frame with a large wingspan and developed muscle tone (added 50-plus pounds since arriving at Kentucky, including 20 pounds between his junior and senior seasons)…forces holding penalties with his ability to work through the shoulder of blockers…plays with closing burst to close the gap in pursuit…loose athlete in space…stays stride- for-stride with backs and tight ends in coverage…intelligent, alert player to see plays develop pre-snap…voted a team captain in 2018…performance doesn’t fall off late in games (13 of his 17 sacks in 2018 came in the second half)…holds the school records for sacks in a single season (17.0) and career (31.5) – his career sack total ranks ninth-best in SEC history, just a half sack behind Reggie White (32)…he is tied with Danny Trevathan for the school record in career forced fumbles (11).","Not heavy-handed at the point of attack…late to disengage from offensive linemen once locked up…pass rush moves tend to be predictable based on situation…plays loose, but lacks twitch when quickly changing direction…needs to improve his contain responsibilities vs. the run…better cover athleticism than cover instincts, especially with his back to the ball.","A three-year starter at Kentucky, Allen was a hybrid outside linebacker in the Wildcats’ 3-4 base, lining up off the edge (boundary and field) and over inside receivers in the slot. After his junior year, he was considered a potential top-100 draft pick, but he returned for his senior season and improved physically and technically, which resulted in one of the best individual seasons in Kentucky history – the 2018 hire of outside linebackers coach (now defensive coordinator) Brad White, who spent the previous six seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, also aided Allen’s development. Although not an overpowering power rusher, Allen showed improved play strength and added to his pass rush tool box on his senior tape, consistently forcing the quarterback to speed up his process. As a cover defender, he has the smooth hips and play speed to cover a lot of ground, but needs to improve his ball awareness to be more reliable in man coverage. Overall, Allen transformed himself from a versatile athlete into a polished pass rusher who fits best in a 3-4 scheme where he can make plays upfield or when dropping in space, projecting as an immediate NFL starter with Pro Bowl potential.

Averaging 12.3 points and 8.1 rebounds as a senior, he also received college basketball offers. On the football field, Sweat was better known as a tight end who would occasionally rush the passer — he was considered a top-60 tight end recruit in the country. He initially committed to Vanderbilt before flipping to Michigan State (over Florida State) with the Spartans wanting to move him to defense full-time. Sweat played in two games in 2014 before taking a redshirt year. He was suspended most of 2015 for a violation of team rules and left the program the following spring (April 2016) for “personal reasons.” After one season at the JUCO level, Sweat was a highly sought-after recruit and committed to Mississippi State over LSU and Texas A&M. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","NFL frame and length…light-footed out of his stance with long strides to quickly eat up grass…core flexibility to lean and maintain his balance…forceful long-arm and introduces various inside/outside moves to keep blockers guessing…improved run awareness and play identification…able to retrace and find the ball…efficient changing directions when tracking the run…comfortable on his feet, dropping in space and covering ground with his long strides…emotional player and not afraid to throw the first punch…effort sustains all four quarters…reached double-digit sacks in both of his seasons in the SEC.","Lean-muscled and lacks ideal bulk on his limbs…questionable growth potential…stiff turning the corner and lacks bend at the top of his rush…needs to play stronger and develop bully tendencies to power through blocks…too often finds himself upfield past the quarterback…flashes pop, but initial hand work still in the development phase…plays tall and rigid once engaged…doesn’t have a great feel in coverage…mysteriously didn’t have any pass break ups in his career despite his length…background requires careful vetting after he spent the majority of his two-year tenure at Michigan State in the coach’s doghouse due to repeated issues …diagnosed with a heart condition at the Scouting Combine, which will require regular check-ups, though it is considered a “low-risk” condition.","A two-year starter at Mississippi State, Sweat rushed from a two- and three-point stance as the field defensive end in the Bulldogs’ four-man front. Since the start of 2017, his 22 sacks are the second-most by any power-five FBS player during that span (Josh Allen), forming a dominant defensive line duo with Jeffery Simmons (they combined for 58.5 tackles for loss the last two seasons). Sweat wins with first step burst and humongous wingspan, although there is room for better efficiency in his pass rush sequence. Overall, Sweat has average play strength and some stiffness in his rush, but he maximizes his length, both his arms and strides, to consistently threaten blockers off the edge, projecting as an NFL starter in either a 3-4 or 4-3 scheme.","1st",7,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,53,14,11.5,1,0,0,35.75,10.5,84.75,4.41,2.57,1.54,36,125,4.29,7,21

Burns was rated as a top-50 recruit in the country and committed to Florida State over Georgia and Florida on signing day. He decided to skip his senior season with the Seminoles and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Twitchy get-off and lateral movements…runs the arc with speed…natural body control to capture the corner and flatten to the quarterback…angular body type with long arms to stab or club-rip blockers…plays with bend and skillfully regains his balance mid-rush…able to change directions with little wasted movement…displays the foot agility and long strides to cover ground and play in space…uses his length to find passing lanes…blocked three kicks over his career…voted a team captain in 2018 and his FSU coaches call him a “humble hustler” who gives “consistent effort” in practice…started every game the past two seasons and played through injuries…his 24.0 career sacks rank fifth in school history.","Lanky limbed athlete and lacks ideal bulk on his frame…questionable max weight…not a power player and can be controlled on the edge (see 2018 Northern Illinois tape)…leaves his chest open and his hand/punch timing requires refinement…hands tend to wander, lacking disciplined counters…prefers to run the arc and needs to develop his inside moves...not much of a talker and is developing his leadership skills.

Despite a disappointing 5-7 record in 2018, which snapped FSU’s 36-year bowl-eligible streak, he stayed motivated and set career-bests in tackles, tackles for loss and sacks as a junior. Burns is a loose-jointed athlete with above-average speed off the edge, also showing the agility to drop in space or defend the run. He flashes a variety of pass rush moves, but tends to be over-reliant on his athleticism and needs to develop his timing and set-up skills. Overall, Burns needs to continue to get stronger and sharpen his toolset, but his first step explosion, athletic flexibility and baseline understanding of how to use his length/hands are a recipe for an impact NFL pass rusher, regardless of scheme.","1st",11,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,52,15.5,10,3,3,0,33.875,10,83.625,4.53,2.62,1.54,36,129,.,7.01,.

Living with his father in Scotch Plains, he spent his freshman and sophomore years at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High. He moved in with his mother (Jennifer Coney) in Plainfield after his father relocated (he doesn’t have a close relationship with his father). Gary transferred to powerhouse Paramus Catholic prior to his junior season, which caused controversy because of transfer rules, but he was ruled eligible prior to the 2014 season, earning New Jersey Defensive Player of the Year honors his junior and senior seasons. USA Today tabbed him as the National Defensive Player of the Year in 2015, finishing his senior season with 55 tackles and 13.5 sacks (and a 3.85 GPA). In the 2016 recruiting class, Gary was not only ranked as the No. 1 player in the state and the No. 1 player in the country, but also the No. 1 ranked recruit all-time according to 247 Composite Rankings (since 2000). He considered offers from Alabama, Auburn, USC and several others before choosing Michigan over Clemson on signing day, continuing the Paramus-to- Michigan pipeline that included Jabrill Peppers and Juwann Bushell-Beatty before him. Gary elected to skip his senior season and the bowl game to enter the 2019 NFL Draft. He also started his own sports agency: “Rashan Gary Sports.”","Gifted athlete for his size…flashes the explosive quickness and light feet of a much smaller player…flexible body type with oily hips to smoothly change directions…rare range…plays with low, balanced pad level…wins the corner with powerful strides…violent hands and effective long-arm move…physical edge setter…uses his length to lock out, shed and pursue…accustomed to dealing with chips, double-teams and extra attention…improved discipline to stay home and read the quarterback…competes with urgency…wants to be a leader and not shy joking around or pushing teammates.","Undeveloped pass rush plan and doesn’t set up his moves…hand placement lacks refinement, with too much time hand fighting…streaky snap timing…duck-footed gait and too easily tripped up…needs to lose some baby fat…NFL scouts have concerns about his emotional maturity and ability to play with composure…inconsistent finisher with below-average college production…suffered several minor injuries his first two seasons in Ann Arbor; injured his right shoulder prior to the 2018 season and tried to play through it, missing three games (October 2018).","A two-year starter at Michigan, Gary was exclusively a hand-on-the-ground edge rusher in the Wolverines’ four-man front, occasionally lining up over or inside the tackle. His talent was clear the moment he stepped foot in Ann Arbor, but his production and body of work didn’t consistently match the hype — eight pass rushers in the 2019 NFL Draft class had more sacks in 2018 than Gary had his entire career (10.5). He is the poster prospect for the “traits over production” scouting motto with his freakish athletic skill and overall upside. He currently lacks an efficient move-to-move transition and I often found myself yelling “finish!” at the screen while studying his tape. Overall, Gary is a high risk, high reward prospect because he has rare athletic talent and natural power for his size, but he showed mediocre development in college with lingering questions about his durability and maturity.","1st",13,9,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,44,7,3.5,0,0,0,34.125,9.625,81.875,4.58,2.67,1.61,38,120,4.29,7.26,26

He earned All-State honors as a junior in 2013 with 60 tackles, 26.0 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks. Ferrell suffered a torn ACL days prior to the 2014 season, missing his senior year. He was ranked as a top-10 defensive end recruit in the country and a top-3 player in the state, narrowing down his college choice to Clemson, Florida State, Michigan, Michigan State, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia Tech. Ferrell committed to Clemson a few months prior to the ACL injury and the Tigers’ coaches stood by him despite the injury. His father (Cleavester Sr.) and mother (Faye) served a combined 46 years in the U.S. Army. His father, who passed away in 2012 from cancer, was a first sergeant who served two tours in Vietnam. Ferrell is the youngest of nine children. He elected to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Good-looking on the hoof with long arms…advanced hand use, displaying strong rip, chop and swipe moves…times up the snap well with quick initial movements…understands depth and how to create rush lanes for himself…lower and upper body mechanics stay on the same page…effective spin and sets up inside moves…uses his length to set a hard edge and stay clean…holds his ground vs. power…disciplined eyes to read/track the football, staying away from mistakes…keeps his head on a swivel and anticipates angle blocks…consistent effort and plays through the whistle, making opposite hash stops…named a 2018 team captain…called a “humble worker” by his coaches…productive resume and started more games (44) than any other pass rusher in Clemson history, passing Levon Kirkland (43).","Not naturally twitchy or explosive in his get-off…only average bend and cornering skills, causing his rush to stall…thrives on jumping the snap, which will lead to offsides penalties…can be squeezed out of gaps by power…lost outside contain more times than expected on tape…didn’t miss time the last three seasons, but didn’t play his senior year in high school due to a torn ACL in his right knee (August 2014), which also forced him to redshirt in 2015; didn’t work out at the pro day after re-aggravating a right turf toe injury (March 2019).","A three-year starter at Clemson, Ferrell earned a starting role as a redshirt freshman and helped fill the shoes of Shaq Lawson and Kevin Dodd, lining up primarily at right defensive end in the Tigers’ four-man base. He had outstanding production the last three years and ranks tied for fourth-best in school history with 27.0 career sacks. Ferrell is a much better NFL prospect than Lawson or Dodd because of his advanced hand tactics and awareness to see plays develop and set up his pass rush sequence. Similar to Preston Smith, he isn’t ultra-twitchy and won’t capture the corner on speed alone, but he has terrific contact balance and power to work off blocks. Overall, Ferrell has only average athleticism for his size, but his mix of power, handwork and recognition skills lead to production, projecting best as a hand-on-the-ground rusher in a 4-3 base.","1st",21,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,54,19.5,11.5,3,4,0,34.125,10.5,82.375,.,.,.,.,114,4.4,7.26,25

In the NFL, explosive players are at a premium because of the importance of the first and last steps, making Polite an attractive prospect with his instant speed and closing burst to finish at the quarterback. However, his maturity has been flagged by multiple NFL teams and will impact his final draft grade.

Overall, Winovich doesn’t have the size, length or explosive traits that NFL teams desire on the edge, but he finds ways to detach from blockers with his flexibility, active hands and relentless play style, projecting as a stand-up rusher in a 3-4 scheme.","2nd-3rd",60,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,69,17,5,0,1,0,32.75,10,78.5,4.59,2.69,1.57,30.5,116,4.11,6.94,18

As a senior, Collier finished with 64 tackles, 15.0 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks, also earning All-District honors as a tight end. He was the No. 53 defensive end in the 2014 recruiting class and initially committed to Texas Tech as a junior before flipping to TCU shortly before signing day.

Collier might not be an ultra-flexible speed rusher, but he stays balanced mid-rush to throw the kitchen sink at blockers. As a run defender, he shows maturing instincts with powerful hands and quick read/react skills.

Ferguson was ranked as the No. 81 defensive end in the 2014 recruiting class and picked up offers from power-five programs like Mississippi State, NC State and Tennessee. However, Louisiana Tech was the first school to show legitimate interest in him and Ferguson developed a strong bond with the coaches, staying committed to La Tech. His younger brother (Jazz) signed with LSU before transferring to Northwestern State and is also part of the 2019 NFL Draft class. His other younger brother (R.J.) plays football at Arkansas-Monticello. Ferguson has a one-year old son (Jyce) with his girlfriend, who is pregnant with their daughter (due in May 2019).

Ferguson strikes with power and pad level, using his reach, physical hands and bully mentality to jar blockers off balance. He needs to clean up some technique issues as a run defender, but he locks out and sees through blocks to shed and pursue.

Nelson also led the basketball team to a 2014 district title, averaging 14.1 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. He grew five inches and added 70 pounds between his freshman and senior years at Waukee, which contributed to him going underrecruited. Nelson was the No. 7 recruit in the state of Iowa and initially committed to Iowa State before flipping to Iowa once they offered (the only two power-five programs to offer him). His father (Jeff) played defensive line at Iowa (1988-92) and his younger brother (Nathan) was a freshman at Iowa in 2018.

His production increased each season, including 9.5 sacks in 2018, which ranked third-best in the Big Ten. Power is the name of the game for Nelson, who is a classic bull rusher, extending his long arms into blocks and grinding with his leg drive. However, he doesn’t show an efficient move-to-move transition and tends to lose steam at the top of his rush, lacking the natural bend to win with edge speed. Overall, Nelson is a tightly wound, predictable pass rusher, but he has the length, competitive make-up and raw power to soften the edge, projecting as a base end in a four-man front who can reduce inside on passing downs.","2nd-3rd",70,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,45,13.5,9.5,0,1,0,34.875,9.875,83,4.82,2.76,1.64,35.5,118,4.23,6.95,18

Crosby recorded 62 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, 6.0 sacks and two forced fumbles as a senior, earning All- District honors. Ranked as the No. 464 recruit in the state of Texas, Crosby received little recruiting interest until he was invited to an Eastern Michigan camp, leaving with a full-ride offer (his only scholarship).

Miller was the No. 1 ranked player in the state of South Carolina and the No. 3 linebacker recruit in the country. He initially committed to Florida prior to his senior year, but kept his options open and ultimately flipped to Alabama. Miller’s father (Corey) was a captain and linebacker at South Carolina (1987-90) before he was drafted in the sixth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, spending nine seasons in the NFL. Miller accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to a hamstring injury.","Tall, leggy frame and fills out his uniform…drops his pads and extends into blockers, creating movement as a rusher…heavy hands at the point of attack to shock his target…flashes the ability to dip and skim the corner vs. tackles…eats up grass quickly with his long strides and flexible joints…efficient track-and-shed player…sees through blocks and doesn’t take himself out of plays…effort and determination aren’t question marks…tipped the scale at 200 pounds out of high school and worked his tail off to gain weight…earned his bachelor’s degree (December 2017) and master’s degree (December 2018)…voted a senior captain.","Plays with urgency, but not burst…aside from his length and long-strides, his pass rush moves are unimaginative…stiff-legged and labors attempting sharp turns around the edge…mechanical when redirecting in space…struggles to make himself skinny through gaps…running back chips are able to slow him down and throw him off schedule…below-average on-field experience and production…suspect durability, missing the 2018 National Title game with a left hamstring strain (December 2018); missed 10 games as a junior with a torn left bicep (September 2017); underwent sports hernia surgery (April 2017).","A part-time starter at Alabama, Miller saw reps at inside and outside linebacker over his career to get on the field and started four games as a senior SAM linebacker in Nick Saban’s 3-4 scheme, standing up and putting his hand on the ground as an edge rusher.

Miller struggles to get around blocks and lacks creativity as a pass rusher, but he has some bend and will put his hands into blockers to go through them. His assignment sound approach and gritty effort will make him a favorite of coaches in training camp.

He was more of an athlete playing quarterback than a true passer (Cominsky: “It was like backyard football, that’s the best way I can describe it”) and he wasn’t on the recruiting radar until Division-II Charleston (W.V.) offered him a partial scholarship with the expectation that he would play either linebacker or tight end. Once he enrolled, the coaches moved him to defensive end where he redshirted in 2014. Cominsky started the next four seasons and developed into a Division-II All-American and NFL prospect.

He helped lead the team to the playoffs as a senior with 61 tackles, 23.0 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks and five forced fumbles, earning All-District honors for the second straight year. Omenihu was the No. 17 defensive end recruit in the 2015 class and committed to Texas during his junior season, sticking with the Longhorns after programs like Florida, LSU and Notre Dame offered his senior year. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Tall, rangy frame with elite arm length and wingspan…pounces out of his stance with a stout punch to lock out and battle at the point of attack…uses his reach and forward lean to steamroll through blockers…stays balanced through congestion…gap sound and understands his role…athletic feet with the loose lower body…didn’t look like a fish out of water when asked to drop…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (Dec. 2018)…strong senior season, leading the Big 12 in sacks.","Room to shed bad weight and add bulk on his narrow frame…taller stature allows blockers to get underneath his pads and out-leverage him…not a bully without forward momentum…inconsistent anchor strength…didn’t make a ton of plays outside his zone…late to locate the football and awareness runs hot/cold…undeveloped handwork as a pass rusher with immature set up and finish.","A three-year starter at Texas, Omenihu moved to a five-technique role in Todd Orlando’s 3-3-5 base scheme, primarily lining up over or inside the offensive tackle. After flirting with the NFL, he returned for his senior year and collected at least one tackle for loss in the final 10 games, giving the Longhorns back- to-back Big 12 Defensive Players of the Year (Poona Ford in 2017). Omenihu does a great job using his length to gain the upper hand, either setting the edge in the run game or manhandling blockers as a bull rusher. However, the mental and technical aspects of his game lack schooling, especially as a pass rusher. Overall, Omenihu flashes on film and boasts the long levers and raw power worth developing, but his spotty instincts and playmaking skills create consistency issues, projecting best as a base end who requires patience.","4th-5th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,45,18,9.5,1,2,0,36,9.375,85.5,4.92,2.86,1.71,36.5,115,4.36,7.48,.

He played quarterback much of his life until his sophomore year of high school when Davis Webb transferred to Prosper. After missing much of his junior year with a broken femur, Banogu posted 10.5 sacks as a senior, earning Third Team All-State honors. He also played basketball and ran track at Prosper, earning All-District honors in track. Banogu went underrecruited as the No. 472 player in the 2014 recruiting class, signing with Louisiana-Monroe (his only FBS-level offer). He redshirted in 2014 and had a breakout freshman campaign in 2015, prompting interest from TCU. He jumped at the opportunity to play closer to home, sitting out the 2016 season and starting every game the last two years for the Horned Frogs. His older brother (Michael) was an offensive lineman at North Texas. Banogu accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Loose lower body and reactive quickness…pursuit speed is his best attribute, closing the gap in chase mode…introduces tempo mid-rush to create suddenness that blockers can’t handle…active hands and feet to keep himself free…smart play recognition, reading screens or options and using his athleticism to make stops…coaches speak highly of his hustle and motivation…chiseled body type and takes care of himself…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…outstanding production (49.0 tackles for loss and 22.0 sacks) in his three seasons on the field, starting every game.","Questionable functional strength…too easily neutralized or driven from his spot in the run game…finesse rusher and lacks a power move…needs to play with more grit in his take-on approach…his feet and hand swipes are predictable, making it easy for blockers to understand his tendencies…loose lower body, but has some stiffness in his hips, hindering his ability to stunt and knife through gaps…needs to be a better finisher.","A two-year starter at TCU, Banogu lined up at left defensive end in the Horned Frogs’ four-man front, standing up and rushing with his hand on the ground. He was most effective on stunts, loops and twists to help open rush lanes for him, doing his best work from a two-point stance. Banogu is a terrific space athlete on tape and backed that up at the Scouting Combine, including an 11’02” broad jump (DL record). He is inconsistent as a point-of-attack player and too often teams found success running the football to his side of the field. Overall, Banogu needs to mature his pass rush sequence and introduce more power to his game, but he plays with athletic twitch, projecting as an NFL nickel rusher with upside in space.","4th-5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,57,18,8.5,2,0,0,33.625,9,80.5,4.62,2.68,1.62,40,134,4.27,7.02,23

Ledbetter was considered a top-10 recruit in the state of Georgia and received offers from every school in the southwest. He initially committed to Alabama, but flipped to Georgia just three weeks after Ledbetter’s older brother (Joseph), who played two seasons of Division-II basketball, accepted a scholarship to play tight end at Georgia.

Ledbetter is a long-levered lineman with the physical appetite and base fundamentals to control the point and set a hard edge. He moves well on his feet, but lacks explosion in his movements and his ordinary athleticism limits his impact radius.

Brailford was the No. 8 recruit in the state of Oklahoma and considered offers from Baylor, Kansas State and Texas Tech before signing with Oklahoma State. He redshirted in 2014 due to injury and received a medical redshirt in 2016, giving him a sixth season of eligibility. However, Brailford elected to skip his final year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.

After redshirting in 2014 and not seeing playing time in 2015, he decided to transfer closer to home to Akron, sitting out the 2016 season due to transfer rules.","Rushes with twitch, long arms and the first step quickness to get up the field…squeezes through gaps (31.5 tackles for loss in 2017-18)…light feet to slip blocks or set up his spin move…introduces a hesitation move to get blockers off balance…showcases the speed to stand up, string runs outside or chase down from the backside…resets his vision well on the move…play motor isn’t a question…excellent tackle production for a defensive end (5.8 tackles per game at Akron).","Tweener body type with thin torso/waist…lacks a power move and struggles to convert his speed to power…too easily pushed around in the run game with chips from tight ends or backs slowing him down…inconsistent edge setter and can be turned from outside lanes…immature hand use and late to set up his arm moves…often finds himself wide of the quarterback…unimpressive sack numbers over his career.","A two-year starter at Akron, Davis played linebacker in high school and at Pitt before moving to defensive end with the Zips, lining up at left end and rushing with his hand on the ground. Pittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner was a mentor for him at Pitt and continues to advise him. An upfield player, Davis is a flexible athlete with the speed to shave the corner or chase in space. He is competitive at the point of attack and won’t back down, but he doesn’t overpower blockers and can be controlled in the run game. Overall, Davis relies on his initial quickness and bend to run the hoop, but the absence of power and know-how currently limits his impact potential, projecting as a developmental stand-up linebacker in a 3-4 scheme.","6th-7th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,82,16,5.5,1,7,1,34.25,10.25,82.375,4.6,2.64,1.6,39,122,4.44,7,19

Roberson was a top-10 ranked recruit in the state of Texas and the No. 66 recruit overall nationally, committing to Texas over Alabama and Texas A&M. He was the highest-ranked recruit in the Longhorns’ 2014 recruiting class, but he lasted only two years in Austin. During his redshirt year, Roberson lost his mother to ovarian cancer, an illness she hid from her son to spare him the grief (he didn’t find out about the cancer until after she passed away). He elected to transfer after the 2015 season and landed at FCS-level Sam Houston State where he played his final three seasons. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game. He used his Pro Day to raise awareness and funds for the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance.","Screams off the edge, penetrating with his first step…stays low out of his stance and extends to pepper blockers…violent hands to swat/rip…natural burst to close on the football…nice job bouncing between gaps on twists…flashes the ability to convert speed to power…terrific motor in pursuit and is never out of range due to his effort…flexible body type to drop, open his hips and cover ground…experienced on the edge and inside over the B-gap…productive senior season as one of only seven FCS players with 20+ tackles for loss…became the first player in school history to lead the FCS in sacks (15.0).","Lean-limbed athlete and lacks ideal bulk…below-average play strength, struggling to disengage once locked up…lacks diversity as a rusher, relying on speed and effort…unrefined hand/arm moves and doesn’t show much complexity in his rush plan…disjointed move-to-move transition…inconsistent edge setter and will leave production on the field…almost all of his experience came vs. FCS-level competition…didn’t last very long in Austin and his interviews will be important.","A two-year starter at Sam Houston State, Roberson played the hybrid “Rush” end position in the Bearkat’s 4-3 base scheme, often reducing inside and lining up as a three-technique. He didn’t have defensive tackle P.J. Hall (second round pick of the Oakland Raiders in the 2018 NFL Draft) to draw attention from opponents in 2018, but his production only improved, matching the school-record with 15 sacks as a senior. Although he lacks efficiency at the top of his rush, Roberson has the ability to get the offense off-schedule due to his burst and motor off the snap. In order to take his game to the next level, he needs to develop his counters and put more thought into his attack. Overall, Roberson doesn’t have a deep tool box as a pass rusher, but he has terrific play speed, effort and length, which is a great place to start, projecting best in a versatile edge role that utilizes his athleticism.","6th-7th",.,11,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,68,20.5,15,5,2,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He lettered in four sports (baseball, basketball, football and track) at Salem Hills, winning the 2015 regional title in the shot put (52-7.5). On the football field, Gustin played quarterback and linebacker and finished his senior season with 152 tackles, 29.0 tackles for loss, 10.5 sacks and two interceptions, adding 2,864 passing yards, 60.7% completions (212-for-349) and 32 total touchdowns on offense. He was named a Parade First Team All-American and First Team All-State in 2014. Gustin ranked as a top-50 recruit in the country and the No. 4 outside linebacker, committing to USC over Arizona State, Ohio State and Utah. His father (John) played quarterback at Wyoming (1991-94); his mother (Scarlett) and aunt (Amberli) were the Gatorade Idaho Girls High School Basketball Players of the Year in 1987 and 1989, respectively, before playing college basketball at BYU; his sister (Lauren) was the Gatorade Utah Girls High School Basketball Player of the Year in 2018 and now plays collegiately; his older brother (Gunner) played wide receiver at Division- II Dixie State. Gustin received an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to injury.","Outstanding size and strength with adequate length…natural joint flexibility and likes to play low…quickly finds his edge speed and controls his arc momentum to shave the corner…violent hands to bury his reach into blockers…proficient with push-pull techniques, getting blockers off-balanced…controls the outside run game, filtering the ballcarrier inside…maniacal approach with his diet and conditioning, he takes care of his body like a well-oiled machine…plays with nonstop effort and merciless intensity…nicknamed “Superman” by his coaches for his ability to tough out injuries…senior captain.","Lacks creativity as a pass rusher, relying more on his raw speed/strength than nuance…can get lost in a crowd and needs to better use his hands to stay detached…tends to react before reading, leaving him vulnerable vs. misdirection and play fakes…inconsistent strike zone as a tackler…at his best getting upfield and not as comfortable in reverse…medicals are a bright red flag, as he’s missed most of the last two seasons due to multiple injuries: missed the second half of his senior season with a fractured right ankle (October 2018) and required surgery; suffered a slightly torn meniscus in his left knee (August 2018) and required minor surgery; broke the big toe on his right foot in practice (Sept. 2017) and required surgery to insert two screws; suffered a torn right bicep (Sept. 2017).","A three-year starter at USC, Gustin was a stand-up hybrid linebacker (a position called the “Predator”) in the Trojans’ 3-4 base scheme and was primarily used as a pass rusher. When on the field, he was productive with almost as many career sacks (21.0) as starts (22.0). However, various injuries kept Gustin off the field (he recorded the most MRIs at the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine), which is cruel irony considering he treats his body like a temple, following a strict diet and workout routine. He passes the eye test and plays a physical brand of football, but needs to add more diversity and discipline to his rush plan. Overall, Gustin is a predictable pass rusher with average athletic traits, but there is a place in the NFL for his off-the-charts intensity and competitive toughness — if he stays healthy.","7th",.,6,5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,28,10,7,0,1,0,33,10,78.5,4.69,2.76,1.63,35.5,119,.,.,31

Georgia Southern, where Johnson’s father (Darryl Sr.) played running back, offered him a preferred walk-on opportunity. FCS-level North Carolina A&T swooped in and made him a late addition to their 2015 recruiting class. Johnson elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Flexible athlete who can bend, dip and corner…loose-jointed movement skills, allowing him to cleanly redirect in space…moves well laterally to sidestep blockers and regain his momentum…skilled at making himself skinny through gaps…owns long arms and large hands…looks comfortable standing up and covering tight ends…puts in the “extra time and effort,” according to his coaches…excellent backfield production with 41.0 tackles for loss over 36 games played.","Lean-limbed frame and lacks ideal body armor…doesn’t have the shed strength to detach once blockers engulf him…sets a soft edge…physical defenders are able to jostle him mid-rush, easily slowing his arc momentum…below-average contact balance, not powering his way through the outside shoulder of blockers…predictable rush with little diversity to his attack plan…ends up on the ground too much…had a tough time when matched vs. better competition.","A two-year starter at North Carolina A&T, Johnson was the field defensive end in the Aggies’ multiple front, leading the MEAC in sacks and tackles for loss in 2018. The past two MEAC defensive players of the year both landed in the top-100 draft picks (Javon Hargrave, Darius Leonard) and Johnson is attempting to make it three in a row. He has a straight-forward pass rush plan: upfield quickness, bend and turn, which worked often vs. FCS-level competition, but it won’t be quite that easy in the NFL, struggling vs. the FBS competition (East Carolina) on the schedule. He doesn’t consistently create his own pass rush lanes and his rush stalls quickly once blockers are able to get their hands on him. Overall, Johnson is a rangy athlete with his long, flexible strides, but his lack of power and balance are obvious, projecting best to a stand-up rush linebacker role in the NFL where he can use space to his advantage.","7th",.,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,50,19,10.5,1,3,0,33.875,10,77.875,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,20

He was often overshadowed by Zach Allen and Landry, but put together a splashy senior season, including a single-game BC record 4.0 sacks vs. Wake Forest, treating the right tackle like a turnstile. Ray is quick out of the chute when he times up the snap, using upfield quickness to skim the corner. However, offenses found too much success running to his side of the field and he requires time to develop his play awareness. Overall, Ray flashes natural pass rush talent with his foot quickness and active arm/hand moves, but his inexperience setting up his rush and struggles setting the edge and are concerns, limiting him to a rush-only subpackage role in the NFL.","PFA",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,44,11.5,9,0,2,0,32.5,9.375,79.25,4.83,2.82,1.67,34,118,4.31,7.34,25

Durham was the No. 75 recruit in the state of Texas and signed with Texas A&M (as a linebacker) over offers from Baylor, Texas Tech and Washington. He moved from linebacker to defensive end prior to the 2017 season, starting the final two seasons for the Aggies. Durham accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Physically strapped together…powerful hands and upper body to set a hard edge…moves well laterally to mirror up/down the line of scrimmage…rushes low and controlled…extends to get his hands involved early in his rush, fighting off jabs and using his grip strength to rip through bodies…stays balanced at the top of his rush to diversify his attack…consistent production each of the last two seasons.","Lacks ideal first step burst to surprise blockers…ordinary arc speed and struggles to turn the corner…doesn’t have a go-to rush move…attempts to use his arm length and forward lean, but they aren’t functional weapons for him…needs to better anticipate and see through blockers to make plays in his gap…effort isn’t a question, but he will wear down on drives…former linebacker and would occasionally drop on tape, but he appears stiff when attempting to make sudden changes in direction.","A two-year starter at Texas A&M, Durham lined up as the boundary defensive end in Mike Elko’s 4-2-5 base scheme, standing up and rushing with his hand on the ground. He arrived in College Station as a linebacker and collected six tackles his first two seasons before moving to defensive end as a junior, leading the Aggies in sacks in 2017 and finishing second in 2018. Durham is a stout run defender and prefers hand-to-hand combat, shedding and keeping himself free. While he competes with urgency, he lacks desired athleticism and bend for an edge rusher and is too segmented in his attack. Overall, Durham has a limited tool box as a pass rusher, but he is a reliable run defender due to his strong hands and balance, projecting as a potential NFL back-up in a four-man front.","PFA",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,50,10.5,6.5,0,1,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He was a productive rush end before moving to linebacker as a senior in the Wolfpack’s 3-3-5 scheme, finishing his career top-five in school history with 22.0 sacks. Reed victimized MWC offensive tackles with his quick first step, dipping at the top of his rush to wrap the corner and close on the quarterback. However, he has short arms and is easily engulfed by blockers, lacking the upper body power to detach or power through contact. Quicker than fast, he looked like a fish out of water dropping in space and covering ground.

After playing a hybrid linebacker role as a junior, he moved to defensive end as a senior with mixed results. Green is a height/weight/speed athlete with adequate play strength, but he is a block magnet and consistently late (off the snap and off blocks), struggling to detach once engaged. As a pass rusher, he lacks a coherent plan and his hand tactics lack the diversity to surprise blockers. In space, he runs well in pursuit, but tight hips and redirection skills likely limit his upside as a linebacker.

Phillips showcases adequate edge speed, balance and flexibility to work around blockers, but most of his production came on effort-based plays rather than by physically dominating opponents. While he introduces his hands early in the rep, he needs to load more ammo into his punch and isn’t going to overpower blockers one-on-one, struggling to convert his speed to power.

Ward was expected to redshirt, but he saw the field quickly as a freshman and proved to be a part-time player. However, he didn’t truly grow out of that role, starting only 10 games over the last four years. Ward passes the eye test and actively uses his length to fight off contact, showing off lateral quicks to cross the face of blockers and affect the pocket.

Williams’ mother (Marquischa) passed away from cancer (August 2010). His older brother (Quincy) played linebacker at Murray State. Williams elected to forego his final two seasons of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Explosive get-off to immediately reset the line of scrimmage…controlled, cat-like quickness to win off the snap, redirect or close in short-areas…lateral agility and clean weight transfer as a pass rusher…uses a variety of swipes, rips and club moves to break the rhythm of blockers…naturally powerful and creates surge with his upper body…produces knockback and steers blockers where he wants…uniquely skilled at keeping blockers off him, using hand tactics and length…holds the point-of-attack and doesn’t get moved…understands gap leverage and how to exploit it…comfortable two-gapping and handling double-teams…above-average ball awareness…sees through blocks and reacts to the ball, not the blocking scheme…accountable and “exemplifies all the things I talk about” on and off the field, according to Alabama head coach Nick Saban…works his tail off and owns a genuine love for the game…All-American 2018 season.                                                                                     [135]","Doughy body type and would benefit from added bulk…only average arm length…occasionally finds himself out of control mid-rush, leading to missed tackles…only one season of production at the college level.","A one-year starter at Alabama, Williams was a defensive end in 2017, but with DaRon Payne leaving for the NFL, he identified nose guard as his best chance to get on the field, adding 25 pounds and emerging as a dominant player in 2018. He finished the season top-10 in the FBS and second in the SEC with 19.5 tackles for loss and didn’t have an “off” game. With his snap quickness and handwork, Williams has a natural feel for defeating blocks and his teammate Jonah Williams hit the nail on the head when he described facing Williams as trying to block a “300-pound bar of soap.” He is a power-packed player from head-to-toe, competing with the violence, hustle and awareness to be an elite run defender. Overall, Williams was not only blessed with a complete skill-set (explosive, strong and intelligent), but he also has the rare ability to use all his gifts in unison, projecting as an immediate NFL starter with All-Pro potential.","1st",2,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,71,19.5,8,0,1,0,33.25,9.625,80.25,4.83,2.8,1.67,30.5,112,.,.,.

He posted 83 tackles, 20.0 tackles for loss, 9.0 sacks and two forced fumbles as a senior to earn USA Today All-American honors. Oliver was considered a top-10 recruit in the country and was courted by all the top programs, including LSU (his dream school). However, he had his heart set on hometown Houston since his sophomore year because that is where his older brother (Marcus) played on the offensive line (Ed Oliver: “I was going to play football with my brother. If he wasn’t already at the University of Houston, I wouldn’t be here.”). Oliver has been coached by A.J. Blum for six of the last seven seasons — four seasons as Westfield defensive coordinator and the past two seasons as Houston defensive line coach. In May 2018, Oliver announced he would enter the 2019 NFL Draft after his junior season.","Fluid body control to wriggle off blocks…excellent foot quickness and change of direction skills…shot out of a cannon with his first step…forces holding penalties due to his gap quickness…creates knockback with his speed-to-power skills…ball awareness to track through blocks…uses natural leverage to stay underneath the pads of blockers…better than expected play strength as a run defender…highly aggressive motor and effort never wanes, chasing down plays near the sidelines…dominated from the moment he stepped onto campus and leaves as a three-time All-American, collecting 54.0 tackles for loss over 33 career starts.","Lacks desired frame and length…needs to continue and develop his body and stay in the 280-285 pound range (weighed 274 for most of his final season at Houston)…relied more on motor than brute power to overwhelm blockers in college…not a bull rusher…undeveloped approach with his hands…below- average counter measures once locked up…faced inferior competition in the AAC…several immature moments in college, including an on-field altercation with head coach Major Applewhite regarding a coat issue on the sideline — Oliver has a “young attitude” and has “growing up to do,” according to an NFL scout…missed five games as a junior with a right knee bruise (November 2018) and was limited at the combine with a strained hamstring (February 2019).","A three-year starter at Houston, Oliver was one of college football’s most disruptive players over the last three years, spending most of his time at nose tackle for the Cougars. With his football flexibility and natural biomechanics, he has rare athletic ability for the position with the backfield vision to recognize play designs and disrupt from different angles. Oliver still requires time to develop his body, mind and technique at the next level. He will struggle with long-armed blockers who get to his frame and control his chest, but his energy and motor are both elite. Overall, Oliver won’t be a natural fit for every NFL scheme, but he is an ideal one-gap penetrator due to his athleticism, instincts and relentless nature, projecting best when he is lined up closest to the football.","1st",5,8,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,54,14.5,3,1,2,0,31.75,9.25,77.375,.,.,.,36,120,.,.,32

Tragically, his grandfather was killed (while face-down on the ground) when the rifle of a SWAT team officer accidently went off during a raid by police (January 2011), who were searching for Stamps’ stepson. Wilkins moved back to Springfield and initially attended East Longmeadow High School before moving to Suffield Academy (Conn.), which is 11 miles from Springfield, just over the state border. He repeated his freshman year and spent four years at Suffield, starring in football, basketball and track. On the basketball court, he was a four-year letterman and became the fourth player in school history to eclipse 1,000 career points. On the football field, Wilkins posted 71 tackles, 22.0 tackles for loss and 8.0 sacks as a senior, finishing his prep career with 253 tackles, 69.5 tackles for loss and 28.5 sacks in 35 games. He was the No. 6 defensive tackle recruit in the 2015 class and narrowed his college list to Boston College, Clemson, Penn State, Ohio State and Stanford, choosing the Tigers. Wilkins chose the No. 42 jersey because his grandfather was born in 1942. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Initial quickness to live in the opponent’s backfield…flexible hips and joints, contorting his good-sized frame and staying balanced through gaps…fluid redirection in pursuit with the chase speed to track down ballcarriers…plays underneath blocks and keeps his lower body working to grind out movement…gap quickness helps clog things up in the run game…recognition skills reflect his experience…well-versed on special teams coverages…scored three touchdowns (two rushing, one receiving) on offense…two-time team captain with the type of work ethic and intangibles that are “up there with Deshaun (Watson) since we’ve been here,” according to a Clemson assistant coach…graduated with a degree in communications (December 2017), becoming the first scholarship player in school history to graduate in two-and-a-half years…his 59 career games played is tied for the most in school history.","Lacks ideal length and point-of-attack power…inconsistent shed technique and timing…can be bullied in the run game…inconsistent base strength and can be displaced by blockers, especially when his pads rise…doesn’t always replace his hands on his get-off, stalling his pass rush…always looking for an edge, but developed a reputation for being a borderline dirty player due to questionable hits…older prospect and will turn 24 during his NFL rookie season.","A three-year starter at Clemson, Wilkins worked his way into the defensive line rotation as a true freshman and was a key reason behind the Tigers’ two national titles the last three seasons. Lining up primarily over the B-gap, he became the school’s fifth unanimous All-American (2018) and the first Clemson player to win the William V. Campbell Trophy, also known as the Academic Heisman. Moving differently than most his size, Wilkins uses his loose lower body, contact balance and active hands in conjunction to squirt through gaps. His high-character intangibles will be a strong selling point for an NFL team looking for a high-floor prospect. Overall, Wilkins is an inconsistent run defender, but his quickness, body flexibility and ball awareness lead to backfield production, projecting as a penetrating three-technique in a four-man base.","1st",8,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,57,15,6,2,2,0,32.5,9.75,78.875,5.04,2.94,1.76,29.5,107,4.55,.,28

As a senior, he earned All-American honors with 105 tackles, 20.5 tackles for loss, 18.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception, despite missing four games due to injury. Simmons was ranked as the top prep player in the state and was the No. 2 defensive end recruit in the nation, behind only Nick Bosa. He narrowed his college choice to Alabama, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Tennessee, choosing the nearby Bulldogs. Simmons was arrested for simple assault shortly after he committed (March, 2016), but was permitted to enroll, serving a one-game suspension and undergoing evaluation. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft. Simmons did not receive an invitation to the combine due to his past assault arrest, and tore the ACL in his left knee while training in February, 2019.","Impressively developed physique with filled out muscle and under 15% body fat…heavy-handed and manhandles blockers with brute power…shows grown-man strength at the point of attack, digging in his cleats and handling double teams…uproots blockers with a forceful bull rush…elite contact balance and rarely displaced…pounces out of his stance…outstanding athlete and looked comfortable dropping in space…lateral quickness and fluidity to loop around blocks…uses his meat hooks to swipe and create rush lanes…quickly finds the ballcarrier when engaged…showed improved attention to fundamentals the last three years…owns the physical mindset to bounce around with offensive linemen for four quarters…blocked three career kicks on special teams…two-time SEC Academic Honor Roll with a cumulative GPA over 3.0…his 32.5 career tackles for loss ranks sixth-best in school history.","Excellent short-area quicks, but not fast or rangy…inconsistent snap timing…tends to flow with the action instead of anticipating…not a polished pass rusher and needs to better set up his moves…arrested and charged for simple assault (March 2016) after a video captured him punching a woman several times after a dispute between the victim and Simmons’ sister at the apartment complex where Simmons lived with his mother; Simmons pleaded no contest and apologized for his role (Simmons, in a since-deleted Facebook post: “Honestly, I wasn’t thinking, all I could think was this is my family and I’m supposed to defend my family”); Simmons was suspended for one game with several conditions attached to his enrollment…suffered a torn ACL in his left knee (February 2019) while training for the draft.","A three-year starter at Mississippi State, Simmons made an immediate impact at the college level, primarily as a nose tackle over the A-gap, and teams had to alter their game plans to run plays away from him. He wears the classic neckroll, bringing flashbacks of Pro Football Hall of Famer Charles Haley with the way he tears through blocks. Simmons is a naturally powerful human and passes the eye test with flying colors, forcing constant double-teams and rarely losing a one-on- one match-up. He isn’t a sudden first step athlete and needs to develop as a pass rusher, but he plays with violence and has the power to win once he gets going. Based on talent alone, Simmons is one of the best players in the 2019 NFL Draft class, but his character grade will be hotly debated because of the disturbing video where he punched a woman already on the ground. In the three years since the incident, he kept his nose clean, did well in school and Mississippi State coaches and officials speak very highly of his maturity, which will keep him on several draft boards around the league. Overall, Simmons is a power-packed player with natural ease of movement to stay balanced at contact, reset the line of scrimmage and hunt the ballcarrier, projecting as an immediate NFL starter with Pro Bowl upside for a team willing to accept his baggage. His recent ACL tear will likely sideline him for the 2019 NFL season and drop him 20-30 spots on draft weekend.","1st",18,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,63,17,2,1,4,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He was considered a better offensive tackle recruit, earning All-State honors as a senior, but he also earned 2014 Defensive Player of the Year honors on defense with 93 tackles, 15.0 tackles for loss and 7.0 sacks. Tillery was the No. 11 offensive tackle recruit and considered a top-five recruit in the state (behind current NFL players like Derrius Guice and Donte Jackson). He grew up in SEC country, but picked Notre Dame because, in his words, “Notre Dame tends to attract pretty adept people to their campus.” He was the first Louisiana native to play in South Bend since 1998 and moved from offense to defense shortly after he arrived. Tillery received an invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but declined due to injury (NFL Scout: “He was looking for a reason not to play, so I’m not surprised he’s not here in Mobile”).","Long, athletic frame…moves well for a big man with lateral quickness, hip snap and flexibility to redirect in a blink…active on stunts and quick to close, eating up grass with his long strides…uses his length to detach from blocks…strong hands to swat, slap and pry his way through gaps…creates immediate movement with his initial surge and forward lean into blockers…long legs allow him to spring laterally between gaps…huge wingspan to corral inside runners…flashes impressive effort to chase down ballcarriers 30 yards downfield…two blocked kicks in 2018…graduated with a degree in economics (May 2018).","Tall center of gravity, allowing shifty runners to shake him in the hole…upright rusher and strikes too high with his arm moves…aimless pass rusher and finds himself upfield behind the quarterback…balance issues when his base narrows…large target and easily moved on down blocks…attracted the “dirty player” label as an underclassman (see 2016 USC tape)…NFL scouts question where football shows up on his priority list and how his makeup will mesh in the NFL…suspended for the 2015 bowl game for a violation of team rules…missed time during 2018 spring practice with a concussion; suffered a left elbow sprain (October 2015); played through a torn right labrum (September 2018) as a senior, requiring off-season surgery (March 2019).","A three-year starter at Notre Dame, Tillery spent most of his time over the B-gap and outside the tackle as an edge defender, lining up across the Irish’s hybrid front. He had his best season as a senior and finished tied for the team lead in sacks (8.0) and forced fumbles (three). Tillery is a loose mover with a powerful punch, using his length to stack, shed and bully. He is an extremely talented player, but teams must be comfortable with his accountability – NFL teams have strong concerns about his “all in?” commitment to football. Overall, Tillery has a vast playmaking radius with length and athleticism, flashing NFL starter potential, but questions about inconsistent on-field play and dedication to his craft are why he wears a “buyer beware” tag.","1st-2nd",32,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,30,10.5,8,3,0,0,34.25,10.625,81,4.93,2.88,1.69,32,115,4.33,7.45,23

He is a smooth mover for a 350-pounder, but his best pass rush tape came when he could get a step of momentum off the edge, currently lacking interior pass rush value.

He earned All-State and All-District honors as a senior with 58 tackles and 16.5 tackles for loss, adding eight catches and two scores on offense. Jones was a four-year letterman on the basketball team as a power-forward. Jones ranked as the No. 10 defensive end recruit in the country and considered offers from Michigan, Iowa and others before committing to Ohio State. He suffered a torn ACL in his right knee (March 2015) playing basketball during his senior season of high school and redshirted his first season in Columbus. Jones’ father (Sanderline Williams) was a professional boxer (1982-93). Jones elected to skip his senior season with the Buckeyes and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Nimble, loose-hipped athlete…initial and lateral quickness pop off the screen…shifty feet, making him a moving target and tough to contain…elite closing speed and uncanny pursuit skills for the position…quick, aggressive hands/reach to swim, swipe, snatch and create spacing…flashes power in his upper body to fend off blockers…first defensive lineman in school history with two defensive scores in a single season (interception return and fumble recovery in 2018)…graduated with a degree in sociology (December 2018).","Tweener frame with a lean lower body…too easily moved in the run game due to his narrow base and marginal anchor strength…pads rise too quickly at contact…doesn’t respond well vs. doubles…inconsistent gap discipline because of his desire to make plays…needs to improve his counter measures when his first move doesn’t work…mediocre production with single digit sacks over 37 career starts…tore the ACL in his right knee (March 2015) playing high school basketball; missed two games after playing around in the locker room and lacerating his left leg on a nail, requiring stitches (September 2017).","A three-year starter at Ohio State, Jones moved from defensive end to under-tackle in Ohio State’s four-man front, setting career-bests as a junior. He took a sizeable step in his development in 2018, expanding his pass rush moves and improving his recognition skills. Jones displays the first step quickness to make himself skinny through gaps and the lateral quickness that makes him near-immune to reach blocks. While he has high upside as a pass rusher, he tends to abandon his base in the run game and lacks the power to recover, allowing blockers to bully him from his spot.

He was also a standout in the shot put and discus, finishing runner-up at the 2013 state championships with a 56-5 shot put. Saunders received track scholarship offers from Wisconsin, Notre Dame and Missouri, but he also wanted to play football and FCS-level Western Illinois was the lone program who gave him that opportunity.

I’m having a daughter…and I’m going to do anything I can to provide for my children.” Saunders displays terrific snap quickness and body control, which is also evident with his back flips during practice. However, he was more of a flash player on tape and didn’t consistently dominate like his traits suggest.

Hill elected to skip his senior season of college and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Pounces off the snap with explosive get-off…moves with the feet of a linebacker…easy lateral movements with the lower body twitch to spring in any direction…comfortable playing tilted due to his hip action to turn himself in the hole…active hands and efficient spin move…violent hand swipe to create an inside path…converts his first step momentum to power, playing with violence…on-field effort is exceptional, routinely making plays away from the line of scrimmage…experienced playing all over the defensive line.                                                                                    [140]","Too willing to sacrifice his balance, ending up on the ground…relies more on gap quickness than rush construction…lacks an efficient pass rush sequence with underdeveloped counters…bends well at the knees to play low, but too often abandons his leverage…average punch and hand strength…bad habit of taking on contact with his shoulder, not his hands…overaggressive nature will make it difficult for him to break down in small spaces…NFL scouts have questioned his emotional maturity…butted heads with the new UCF coaching staff, losing his starting spot in 2018.","A two-year starter at UCF, Hill was a key cog in UCF’s 3-4 base defense his first two seasons, moving to a rotational nose tackle role in a 4-3 as a junior. He spent most of the 2018 season as a reserve because he was late buying in to the new coaching staff, scheme and responsibilities. Hill was routinely the first defensive lineman to cross into enemy territory on tape, quickly finding the football and making plays in the hole. Although he has quick feet/hands to shoot gaps, his eyes are bigger than his stomach and he doesn’t have a deep tool box as a rusher, relying more on his first step and motor. Overall, Hill is an outstanding athlete for a 300+ pounder with the movement skills to develop into an NFL backfield disruptor if he matures both on and off the field, projecting best as one-gap three technique.","3rd-4th",91,12,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,36,10.5,3,0,0,0,33.375,10.25,78.875,5.04,2.88,1.73,35,115,4.38,7.7,28

He was a star in the 400, 800, 1500 and 3200 races and qualified for the Junior Olympics. He played defensive end on the football field and after recording 77 tackles as a junior, Wise posted 49 tackles and 5.0 sacks as a senior. He was the No. 46 defensive end in the 2014 recruiting class and committed to Kansas over offers from Colorado, Missouri and Texas Tech. His father (Deatrich, Sr.) was a ninth-round pick (No. 242 overall) in the 1988 NFL Draft out of Jackson State and played two seasons at defensive tackle in the NFL before spending most of his professional career in the CFL and AFL (he also coached in college and the AFL). Wise’s older brother (Deatrich, Jr.) was a fourth-round pick (No. 131 overall) in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Arkansas and is a defensive end for the New England Patriots. His younger brother (Solomon) is a rising junior defensive end at UTSA. Wise accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Quick off the ball to knife through gaps and disrupt the backfield action…looks comfortable on his feet when dropping and taking away screens…best pass rush move is a long-arm into the blocker…competes with aggressive hands…stout at the point of attack to stack the run…plays with consistent effort and won’t take plays off…two-year team captain…work ethic was instilled in him at a young age…four-year starter and well-versed up and down the line of scrimmage, lining up both inside and outside on the defensive line.","Tweener body type…good snap quickness, but doesn’t play with burst…lacks the contact balance or play strength to power through arm blocks at the line of scrimmage…not going to win in a phone booth…doesn’t generate a consistent push as a pass rusher…pads get too high, allowing blockers to turn him from run lanes…needs continued development with his play recognition and gap discipline…production declined from his junior to senior season.","A four-year starter at Kansas, Wise was an interchangeable lineman for the Jayhawks’ multiple fronts over the years, lining up mostly as a five-technique on early downs as a senior and moving to three-technique on passing downs. He finished his career with 44.0 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, which ranks second-best in school history (behind his former teammate Joe Dineen) and has certainly benefited from his father and older brother playing professionally. Wise has a quick first step and plays a high percentage of snaps, tapping into the endurance he learned from his long-distance track background. He can be tough to lock down in the run game, but he won’t win in a phone booth, that’s not his game. Overall, Wise is average-at-best from an athletic and power standpoint, but he competes his tail off with determined hands and the scheme-diverse experience to be a rotational player in various fronts.","4th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,12.5,5,0,0,0,33,10,80.5,5.28,3.05,1.8,27.5,112,4.37,7.53,22

He posted 102 tackles and 19.0 tackles for loss his senior season, but he received very little recruiting interest because he was undersized (240 pounds) and there were academic concerns. Buggs signed with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College and recorded 18.0 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks over his two seasons at the JUCO level, earning First Team All-MACJC honors both years. He was considered a five-star JUCO recruit and committed to Alabama over LSU and Auburn. Buggs accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Athletic big man with compact build…balanced feet to loop and work around bodies…fluid hips and body control to squirt through gaps…stays low out of his stance with high knees to create force…active hands and powers his way through the shoulder of blockers…keeps his upper and lower body mechanics on the same page…natural contact balance to work down the line of scrimmage…teammates call him the “energy-starter” and not shy speaking up and being a leader when necessary…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…experienced playing inside and outside the offensive tackle.","T-rex arms and can be neutralized when strong-armed blockers attack his frame…struggles to anchor vs. multiple blockers…needs to set a harder edge…only average outside range vs. the run and will give up boundary plays…leans into blockers longer than necessary and relies too much on his shoulder…doesn’t show much deception in his pass rush sequence…instincts are still a work-in-progress.","A two-year starter at Alabama, Buggs played defensive end in Nick Saban’s 3-4 base scheme, lining up over or slightly outside the offensive tackle. He had a strong senior season, finishing No. 1 on the team in sacks (9.5) and No. 2 in tackles for loss (13.5). Buggs moves well for his size with active feet in his pass rush and aggressive handwork to unlock from single blocks. His lack of length shows vs. doubles and his ball awareness is still developing, but he compensates with his energetic play style. Overall, Buggs might not offer a dominant trait, but he competes with an efficient mix of athleticism, power and versatility to interchangeably play either interior tackle spot in a four-man front.","4th",.,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,51,13.5,9.5,2,3,0,31.25,9.25,75.5,5.15,3.01,1.81,24.5,96,4.83,8.01,20

After a standout junior season, he was dominant as a senior with 107 tackles, 43 tackles for loss and 15 sacks, earning All-American honors. Willis was a top-5 recruit in the state of Louisiana and one of the best defensive tackle recruits in the country, spurning Alabama, USC and his home state’s LSU to play at Florida. He lasted only one season in Gainesville before he was dismissed due to several incidents, transferring to Miami. He missed the 2017 season after a leave of absence from the team to attend to personal issues, playing on the scout team upon his return. His older half-brother (Landon Collins) is an All-Pro safety for the Washington Redskins. Willis accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to a groin injury.","Outstanding gap quickness…plays with first-step explosion, making it tough for blockers to reach him…second and third steps are as strong as his first, bearing down on quarterbacks before they expect it…plays with purpose and his motor sustains through the whistle…shows an efficient swim and club-rip…doesn’t have an off-hand…named a team captain and coaches say he matured as a senior compared to his past (former Miami head coach Mark Richt: “He truly is one of our leaders”)…strong final season, leading the ACC in tackles for loss per game (1.5).","Undisciplined and fueled by emotion…always in a hurry, leading to offsides or overrunning his gap…can be turned and shielded from the lane…too easily loses sight of the ball…shouldn’t be expected to handle two-gap responsibilities…tends to wear himself out…history of multiple incidents with teammates while at Florida, including sending Skyler Mornhinweg to the emergency room (October 2014) after a fight over cleats…was suspended multiple times at Miami for minor violations before taking a leave of absence (when he returned for the 2018 season, he said he was “a changed person, a changed man.”…suffered a torn MCL (October 2016), which required off-season surgery; missed the bowl game with hand injury (December 2018); missed the combine with a left groin (February 2019) injury.","A one-year starter at Miami, Willis was the Hurricanes’ starting under-tackle in 2018 and put together a strong final season. After his first four years in college were a roller coaster of obvious talent and frustrating decisions, he was named the team’s Jack Harding Team MVP as a senior. Willis is tough to slow down due to his first step and gap speed, but he is a tad straight-linish and needs to contain his aggressive approach to play smarter. His interviews will be paramount due to his checkered past. Overall, Willis affects the backfield action with his initial quickness and energy, but he is an inconsistent run defender due to his undisciplined approach, projecting as an NFL three-technique who needs to prove he is more than just a flash player.","4th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,59,18,4,0,2,0,33,8.5,76.5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

As a junior, he posted 97 tackles, 36.0 tackles for loss, 6.0 sacks and eight forced fumbles. Mack finished with 78 tackles and 5.0 sacks as a senior, earning multiple All-American honors. He ranked as the No. 4 defensive tackle in the 2015 recruiting class and was the No. 2 player in Texas behind LB Malik Jefferson. Mack could have attended any program he wished and ultimately chose Texas A&M over LSU, joining Kyler Murray and Christian Kirk as five-star recruits in the Aggies’ 2015 class. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game and was a late addition to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Built low to the ground with thick hips, calves and bubble…quick first step and routinely the first defensive lineman to pounce…generates power from his lower body and initial momentum…hard guy to slow down when he keeps his pads low and legs churning…wins one-on-one battles when both his upper and lower halves are firing…twitchy muscles and doesn’t play stiff…powerful base to leverage the point of attack and occupy multiple blockers…breakout senior season under the new coaching staff, posting career-bests in tackles for loss (10.0) and sacks (5.5).","Undeveloped hand work…little semblance of a pass rush outside his initial surge…not a rangy lineman and won’t make plays outside his zone…motor runs hot/cold due to fatigue…caught lunging and can be removed from his feet if not squared… struggled with confidence issues…needs to be with a coaching staff willing to motivate and push him…only 15 career starts and lacks an expansive body of work.","A one-year starter at Texas A&M, Mack arrived in College Station as a highly sought after five-star recruit, but struggled to match the hype his first three seasons. He has been open with NFL teams about how he struggled with depression, stemming from his parents’ divorce his freshman year of college and his struggles on the football field as an underclassman. Mack moved to nose guard in 2018 under new defensive coordinator Mike Elko and had a strong final season as part of a defense that ranked No. 3 nationally in rushing yards allowed (95.2 per game). He stays low in his stance and bursts off the snap to attack blocks, using his natural leverage and powerful base to be disruptive when he uses his hands correctly. Overall, Mack offers limited pass rush value if his initial surge is ineffective, but he is a squatty fire hydrant who will stack blockers and clog up run lanes, projecting as a rotational nose tackle in the mold of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Javon Hargrave.","4th-5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,10,5.5,0,1,0,31.25,10.25,76.5,5.1,2.98,1.73,27,102,4.95,8.02,30

Although he lined up primarily over the A-gap, Watts moved all over the Razorbacks’ front, utilizing his foot quickness and physical play style to be disruptive. He is highly active as a pass rusher, but tends to sacrifice his balance and needs to show improved timing/strategy with his rush moves. Overall, Watts needs to mature his pad level and discipline, but his upper and lower halves stay on the same page with the raw power and length to stack-and-shed, projecting as a three-technique in a four-man scheme or five-technique end in odd fronts.","4th-5th",.,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,49,8.5,7,3,2,0,33.375,9.625,80.125,5.23,3.04,1.8,.,.,.,.,.

He was listed as an end on the depth chart, but he also played substantial snaps over the A-gap and B-gap in 2018 as the Aggies took advantage of his versatility. Keke is an active athlete and moves well on his feet to slip blocks and chase in pursuit. He flashes upper body strength, but plays too high and is too easily slowed by road blocks, lacking pass rush tempo or core strength to consistently work through contact.

However, Gaines flipped to Washington once Chris Petersen was hired as the Huskies’ coach in December 2013. He was married to his wife (Sheyeann) in July 2017 and they had a son in March 2019.

He was the 2018 Morris Trophy winner as the Pac-12’s top defensive lineman, which is voted on by opposing players in the conference. Gaines displays a natural feel for the game with war daddy pursuit, but he is more active than athletic. While he offers marginal pass rush value, he plays stout and gap sound, understanding his role. Overall, Gaines has size and playmaking limitations, which will minimize his NFL impact, but he anchors vs. the run and gives consistent effort, projecting as a reserve run stuffer in the NFL.

He posted 73 tackles, 10.0 sacks and three forced fumbles as a senior, finishing his prep career with 208 tackles, 35.0 tackles for loss and 28.0 sacks. Huggins was a Parade All-American and the top overall recruit in the state, ranking as the No. 12 defensive tackle recruit in the 2015 class. With dozens of offers, he ultimately chose Clemson over Georgia, becoming the first consensus top player in South Carolina to sign with Clemson since 2008 (Da’Quan Bowers).","Naturally strong…balanced on his feet and doesn’t labor in his movements…stays low out of his stance to peer through gaps and get upfield…doesn’t play stiff, showing knee bend and efficient recoil in his upper half…flashes pop in his hands with the length to attack blockers before they get to him…displays an arm- over or swim once he gets to the shoulder of blockers…his coaches say he didn’t gripe about playing time and accepted his part-time role.","Initial step lacks suddenness…late to gain proper body position due to tardy play recognition…too much wasted energy and relies more on effort than efficiency…lacks complexity with his technique…rushes tall and gets himself off-balance in his swim move…holds the point, but his power doesn’t translate as a bull rusher…part-time player with minimal production and an unimpressive resume.","A part-time starter at Clemson, Huggins would have started at most other programs, but he was stuck behind Christian Wilkins and Dexter Lawrence on the depth chart. He contributed as a sub-package interior lineman and logged four career starts, two of which came in the 2018 Cotton Bowl and subsequent national title game, when Dexter Lawrence was suspended. Despite not playing a full-time role, Huggins finished with almost as many snaps (408) as Lawrence (460) in 2018 and flashed potential when on the field. He will occasionally make his way to the other side of the line of scrimmage, but his lack of burst and undeveloped play recognition will make it much tougher vs. NFL blockers. Overall, Huggins is a long-armed, powerful plugger, who isn’t a rangy mover or pocket-pusher, but has the raw strength to develop into a solid NFL run defender if he properly applies pro coaching.","6th",.,15,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,30,3.5,2.5,0,0,0,33.5,10.625,80.25,5.12,2.98,1.8,25.5,101,4.84,7.84,35

He led the program to back-to-back 6A state championship games his final two prep seasons. As a senior, Cowart had an All-American campaign with 21.0 tackles for loss and 11.0 sacks, finishing his high school career with 185 tackles and 29.0 sacks. Not only was he considered the country’s top defensive end recruit, but many considered him the top prize in the 2015 recruiting class, receiving interest from every top program in the country. He narrowed his choice to Auburn and Florida, choosing the Tigers on signing day. He found himself lost on the Tigers’ defensive line depth chart and combined for only 12 tackles in reserve duty his first two seasons. Cowart played the first three games of 2017 before asking for his release from the program because his mother was dealing with health issues and he barely saw the field at Auburn. He returned home and enrolled at Hillsborough Community College to keep up with his academics while he cared for his mother (he doesn’t have a relationship with his father, who has been in and out of prison). Cowart graduated from community college and signed with Maryland in the 2018 recruiting class.

Once considered the top high school recruit in the country, football doesn’t appear to come natural to him and he was buried by immense expectations at Auburn. Cowart has a muscular frame with adequate movements and point-of-attack strength, but he struggles to add up his talented parts to equal on-field production. He shows very little complexity to his pass rush plan and lacks a high impact radius in the ground game.

Beckner was considered one of the top prizes of the 2015 recruiting class, ranking as the No. 3 defensive tackle and the No. 13 recruit nationally. He strongly considered offers from Florida State and Ohio State, but decided to stay home and signed with Missouri. Beckner received an invitation to the East-West Shrine Game, but turned it down, choosing instead to focus on his training.","Strong upper body to extend, lock out and detach…fluid frame and agile feet, making plays up and down the line of scrimmage…when he times up the snap, he shows the initial quicks to swim through gaps…contact balance to battle through the trash and find run lanes…voted a team captain and found his leadership voice as a senior, according to his teammates…developed a more professional approach as an upperclassman…started every game the last two seasons.","Consistently late off the snap and loses the leverage battle, allowing blockers to move him…struggles to drop his hips and anchor and too easily bullied by doubles…streaky ball radar and backfield vision…gets out of control in his movements…motor tends to spurt and you don’t see the same relentless player on each snap…quick to gear down when the play isn’t run at him…medical evaluation will be important: suffered a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee (November 2015) and then tore the ACL in his left knee (October 2016)…served a suspension following his arrest for marijuana possession (January 2016) after a traffic stop.","A three-year starter at Missouri, Beckner lined up primarily over the A-gap as a shaded one-technique, but also saw snaps at the three-technique in the Tigers’ four-man front. After battling knee injuries early in his career, he started all 26 games the last two years with double-digit tackles for loss both seasons. Beckner moves well for his size, but struggles if he doesn’t win with his first step and needs to focus on maturing his upper body to get the most out of his ability. Although his tape has several splash plays, his wasted motion leads to wear down with inconsistency from snap-to-snap.

Although he tends to wear down, Slayton is a power-packed lineman with the toughness and demeanor required for the position. However, he doesn’t display disruptive traits and his suspect instincts and shed skills might limit his ability to two-gap.

Walker was the No. 29 defensive tackle in the 2014 recruiting class and committed to Virginia Tech over Nebraska, Penn State and South Carolina. He played as a true freshman, but when Luther Maddy was granted an extra year of eligibility in 2015, Walker redshirted that year. His older brother (Rijo) was a four-year safety at Virginia; his father (Richard Sr.) played collegiately at California (Pa.); his uncle (Adam) spent five years in the NFL as a running back, winning Super Bowl XXIX with the San Francisco 49ers.

He was an every-down player and the motor didn’t slow, competing like the type of player who understood it was an NFL audition every time he stepped onto the field. Walker doesn’t check every box for evaluators, but he is an overachiever who uses his strengths as a player to be productive. He made a significant impression on the Virginia Tech coaches for the way he played and carried himself (defensive coordinator Bud Foster: “He’s an elite football player. Elite young man all the way around, just how he goes about everything he does”). Overall, Walker has little margin for error due to his average play strength and lack of length, but his quickness, hand use and relentless effort are translatable traits, projecting as a rotational NFL three-technique.","6th-7th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,49,10.5,2,2,1,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Bledsoe was the No. 2 recruit in the state of Kansas and narrowed his choice to Oklahoma and his hometown Kansas, ultimately choosing the Sooners. He saw immediate playing time as a true freshman, but the NCAA suspended him for a full year after he tested positive for Clomiphene, a banned performance-enhancing drug (October 2016). Bledsoe claimed that he unknowingly consumed the substance after using some of his teammates’ protein drink. Despite a lawsuit, the suspension was upheld, and Bledsoe lost an extra season of eligibility, forcing him to leave school after his junior season.","Good-sized athlete with a moldable frame…peppers blockers with his punch…active at the point of attack, using his lower and upper halves in unison to work off contact…moves well laterally to scrape and find the run lane…better than expected movement skills, smoothly redirecting in space…active in pursuit with functional range…finished third on the team in passes defended (seven) in 2018…coaches call him “tough-minded” for the way he battled back from his suspension.

With his heavy, active hands, Bledsoe stays balanced at the point of attack with a radar for run lanes. However, he is still growing, both physically and mentally, and must improve his pad level to answer NFL power.

Christmas flashes the length and stack strength needed for combat, but he doesn’t have the know-how to out-maneuver blockers. While the effort shows on tape, his development appears stuck in neutral. Overall, Christmas is a powerful, well-built player with decent feet, but his lack of instincts and technique at the point-of-attack will be tough to overcome — his best chance to make a roster will be as the pet project for a defensive line coach.","PFA",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,28,3,0,0,2,0,32.75,9.125,78.5,5.08,2.94,1.76,25.5,101,5.07,8.13,22

He again earned First Team all-state honors as a senior (67 tackles, 1.5 sacks) and led Flanagan to the 2015 Class 8A state championship. Considered a top-50 recruit in the state of Florida, Bush committed to Michigan despite several connections to Florida State where his father (Devin Sr.) played football and sister (Deja) plays softball. Devin Bush Sr. helped lead Florida State to the 1993 National Championship and was a first-round safety (26th overall) to the Atlanta Falcons in the 1995 NFL Draft. He later won Super Bowl XXXIV with the St. Louis Rams. Bush Sr. was the head coach at Flanagan (2013-2015) for three seasons before joining the Michigan coaching staff as an analyst (moved in with his son in Ann Arbor). Bush Jr. elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Above-average speed and lateral range to mirror…elite level reaction quickness due to his instincts and athleticism…displays the range to cover quick screens and flat routes…controls himself well on the move, settling his feet and squaring up his target…fills gaps like a much bigger player, physically taking on lead blocks — doesn’t have the size of a thumper, but that doesn’t stop him from trying to thump…strikes with violence and wraps as a tackler…understands field leverage and pursuit angles…quick to diagnose coverage and find passing lanes…outstanding blitzer with his bend and closing burst…disciplined off the field and passionate on the field, giving 100% effort on every down (Michigan defensive coordinator Don Brown: “This guy is special…plays with a chip on his shoulder and can flat out fly.”)…voted a team captain in 2018.","Undersized and lack of ideal length shows up often on tape…struggles to disengage once locked up…climbing blockers too easily eliminate him from plays…lack of inches leads to broken tackles…knocked around when working downhill in the trenches…will attempt to run around blockers instead of using his hands…room to improve his strike zone as a tackler to avoid hits above the shoulders…competitiveness can go too far at times (i.e. when he scuffed up the Michigan State logo with his cleats after a pregame spat in October, 2018).","A two-year starter at Michigan, Bush played inside and outside linebacker in Don Brown’s base 4-2-5 defense and was called the “glue” of the scheme, according to his coaches. He grew up around the game and has a special father-son bond, which has helped mold his football-focused mindset. Bush checks boxes for speed, instincts and tenacity, but he falls slightly below-average in the size department, which will be critiqued differently by each NFL club and system. He will get washed and lost in the sea of bodies near the line of scrimmage, but there is no doubting his toughness, football character and competitive drive (and it isn’t manufactured — he has a genuine energy and enjoyment for hunting the football and playing physical). Overall, Bush doesn’t have ideal take-on skills to thrive inside as a MIKE, but his ability to diagnose, his reaction quickness and his closing speed are special, projecting best as an impact starting WILL in the NFL.","1st",10,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,79,9.5,5,0,6,0,32,9.625,76.5,4.43,2.58,1.53,40.5,124,4.23,6.93,21

He played basketball at North Webster, but he developed a stronger love for football during middle school, starting varsity as a freshman. He played both ways at running back and linebacker, rushing for 1,650 yards (7.9 yards per carry) and 31 touchdowns as a senior. White finished his prep career with 5,031 rushing yards and 81 scores, also racking up 192 total tackles on defense. He was recruited primarily at running back and was ranked as a top-10 recruit in the state of Louisiana. White narrowed his college choice to Alabama, Arkansas, Florida State, LSU and Ole Miss before deciding to stay in-state. He arrived in Baton Rouge with hopes of staying at running back, but with a depth chart that included Leonard Fournette and Derrius Guice, White elected to move full-time to defense. He owns seven horses, including Daisy Mae, who he housed near LSU’s campus. His cousin (Charcandrick West) has played five seasons in the NFL at running back. White elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Unlocks his speed and chases down ballcarriers…active motor expands his range and allows him to cover every inch of the field…plays with short-area explosion to redirect and slither through gaps near the line of scrimmage…loves to scrape-and-bang in the trenches…hungry tackler, starving for contact…competes with a violent edge and looks to tune up his target…shows timing and a closing burst as a blitzer…alpha type mentality and named a 2018 team captain (LSU DC Dave Aranda: “People listen to him and respect him...his passion shows both on and off the field”)…durable and started all but one game the last two seasons (didn’t start the 2018 Alabama game because he missed the first half due to a targeting ejection the week prior)…consistently productive, leading the SEC in tackles each of the last two seasons.","Flies around the field without coming to balance, making tackles tougher than they need to be…loses his footing and takes false steps due to his crazed movements…undeveloped anticipation and needs to quicken his reads…needs to more efficiently use his hands to stay clean…needs to better identify targets in zone and develop a better feel for coverage…showed maturation at LSU and character isn’t considered a red flag, but was charged with two misdemeanors his senior year in high school — charged with “carnal knowledge” of a 14-year-old girl when he was 17 years old (November 2015); charged with “flight from an officer” (December 2015) after he received a speeding ticket and didn’t immediately pull over.","A two-year starter at LSU, White played the “Rover” linebacker position in Dave Aranda’s 3-4 base scheme, lining up both inside and outside the tackles and playing on special teams coverages. He was the unquestioned leader of the defense and looked like an excited air traffic controller pre-snap, identifying keys and communicating with his teammates. A see-ball, get-ball type, White is raw instinctually and flies around like a mad man, which is his best and most concerning quality. Everything he does is full speed, which leads to violent hits, but also breakdown issues, falling off tackle attempts. Overall, White’s tape doesn’t show the same level of instincts or discipline as current Bears LB Roquan Smith, but his play speed and relentless nature are off-the-charts, projecting as an NFL starter similar to Jarrad Davis (drafted No. 21 overall to the Detroit Lions in the 2017 NFL Draft).","1st",12,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,123,12,3,3,6,0,32.125,9.75,75.875,4.42,2.58,1.56,39.5,118,4.17,7.07,22

He quickly put his name on the recruiting map and had an All-State senior season with 115 tackles, 5.0 sacks and four forced fumbles. Wilson finished his high school career with 250 tackles, 18.5 sacks and a 3.5 GPA, putting his personal life on the right track after he struggled to stay out of trouble growing up (his parents were divorced, and his father was “locked up in jail a lot”). He was ranked as the No. 2 linebacker in the 2016 recruiting class and a top-20 recruit overall, receiving scholarship offers from every major program in the country. Wilson narrowed his college choice to Alabama and Georgia, choosing to follow in the footsteps of his former Carver teammate (and current Redskins LB) Shaun Dion Hamilton and sign with the Tide. Wilson chose to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Excellent space athlete…light-footed and cleanly redirects…rangy in coverage and comfortable carrying receivers on crossers or verticals…quick to trigger, unlock his hips and pursue…reads the eyes of the quarterback from various depths and angles…violent hit-lift-drive tackler when he calms his feet and stays square…uses his long arms to wrap and ground ballcarriers…natural ball skills and takes advantage of his opportunities (six interceptions the past two seasons)…physical hands to shock and bounce off blockers…competes with an attacking mindset and burst as a blitzer.","Poor habits in pursuit…inconsistent finisher due to excited feet and wild angles, flying past his target or letting ballcarriers out of his grasp…late to anticipate or leverage blocks…tends to attack before reading, leading to false steps…minimal production behind the line of scrimmage…better cover athleticism than cover instincts right now…played through a right foot injury his sophomore year until it “popped out of place” vs. LSU (November 2017), requiring surgery…only one full season as a starter.","A one-year starter at Alabama, Wilson took over as the full-time MIKE linebacker in Nick Saban’s 3-4 scheme as a junior and produced mixed results. He was pegged early on as the next first-round linebacker in the Alabama pipeline, but his development appeared stagnant throughout the 2018 season, not taking the expected steps in his growth as a player. Wilson is a good-sized athlete with the fluid movements, field range and ball awareness to make plays against the pass and the run. However, he needs to become more refined to be a reliable playmaker, projecting similarly to an inconsistent version of Colts’ linebacker Darius Leonard. Overall, Wilson’s wild play, undisciplined approach and lack of anticipation are holding him back, but he is an impressive size/speed/strength athlete with the versatile skill-set to develop into a true three-down NFL player.","2nd",54,15,15,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,71,5,1,0,7,2,32.375,9.25,75.875,.,.,.,32,117,.,.,.

Tavai went overlooked as a recruit and ranked as the No. 326 player in the state of California, receiving interest from USC as a tight end, but his recruitment was lost in the coaching change. He signed with Hawaii (his lone FBS-level offer) as a linebacker and moved in with family on the islands, which helped his transition to the new culture. Tavai has several brothers who played college football, including his older brother (J.R.) who starred at USC before spending time with the Tennessee Titans. Tavai didn’t participate in the 2019 Senior Bowl because of his shoulder injury.","Outstanding size and length for the position…physical, knockback tackler…uses his long arms to corral tacklers when not squared…flashes violence in his hands to strike, shed and find the football…above-average chase skills, accelerating and closing the gap…fills with pop and low pad level, not giving ground…quick to key and diagnose, making plays in the backfield (41.0 career tackles for loss)…flashes bend and an active chop/rip moves as a blitzer…moves clean in coverage, flipping his hips and staying balanced in reverse…developed his leadership skills as a senior (flew back to Hawaii after his surgery to rejoin and support his teammates for the final few games of 2018).","Overaggressive reads, attacking the wrong gap or creating false steps…needs to better find his balance and calm his momentum to finish tackles…plays tall and would benefit from a more accurate strike zone…needs to finish through his hips as a tackler…late to leverage blocks and shed once linemen attack his chest…needs to improve his awareness in zone coverage…missed the final five games his senior year with a grade 3 AC joint sprain in his right shoulder (November 2018), requiring surgery…arrested for third-degree misdemeanor assault (June 2018) for his involvement in an altercation at a Honolulu night club (suspended for the 2018 season opener).

Tavai has the size, length and athleticism to be a modern-day NFL defender, moving well laterally, dropping in space or blitzing as an edge rusher. His shoulder injury kept him from participating at the Senior Bowl and Combine, allowing him to fly under the radar as a prospect. Overall, Tavai needs to tidy up his anticipation and break down skills, but he has true three-down ability with his physicality vs. the run and athleticism to drop in coverage, projecting as a hybrid linebacker with inside-outside versatility.","2nd-3rd",65,8,8,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,82,5.5,2,1,2,0,31.875,9,78,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Pratt was considered the No. 29 safety recruit in the country and held offers from teams NC State, Notre Dame and Tennessee, choosing the Wolfpack.

He chose to play football collegiately and was the No. 22 safety in the 2014 recruiting class, initially committing to Purdue before flipping to Notre Dame once the Irish offered prior to his senior year. Tranquill comes from an athletic family: his grandfather was an All-American football player at Samford; his younger brother (Justin) is a rising senior defensive back at Western Michigan. He married his wife (Jackie) in July 2018. Tranquill accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Owns an abundance of smarts and toughness…trusts what he sees and plays fast and confident…competes with plus timing and reaction quickness…flashes violence in his hands to strike then shed…sound, physical tackler, wrapping to finish…sharp angles in pursuit…intelligent zone player, undercutting routes and pouncing at the catch point…stays attached to tight ends on digs or down the seam…Academic All-American and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering (May 2018) with a 3.73 GPA…experienced at three different positions the last three years…two-time team captain and “the model for what a football player is,” according to ND defensive coordinator Clark Lea.","Adequate athlete, but doesn’t play with explosive traits…inconsistent eyes and can be manipulated in coverage…hugging is a common problem, leading to pass interference penalties…marginal ball skills…durability is a red flag, suffering ACL tears in his left knee (November 2014) and right knee (September 2015); missed time as a senior with a high right ankle sprain (Oct. 2018) and broken left hand (Oct. 2018), playing through both injuries…will be a 24-year old NFL rookie.","A three-year starter at Notre Dame, Tranquill started his collegiate career at safety before moving to a hybrid rover position in 2017 and then to “Buck” linebacker in 2018. His position changes corresponded with three different defensive coordinators the last three seasons, earning high praise from each. Tranquill is a football lifer during the week (nutrition, weights, film) and on game days (tempo-setter), competing with the passion that raises the level of his teammates. He struggles to match the burst of offensive players in coverage, showing only average range on film. Overall, Tranquill might not have the consistency of a three-down player, but he sets the tone and his football intelligence, trademark toughness and versatile athleticism will be an asset for an NFL team, projecting as a special teams ace and subpackage linebacker.","4th",.,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,86,9,3.5,0,4,0,31.5,9.75,74.25,4.57,2.65,1.59,37.5,122,4.14,6.94,31

He moved from defensive end to linebacker as a junior and posted 204 tackles and four interceptions in 2013, leading the team to the Division III State Title. Despite missing the first month of the 2014 season with an Achilles Tendon injury from track, Burr-Kirven finished his senior year with 116 tackles, 1,086 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns, earning Division-III State Player of the Year honors. He was the No. 87 ranked recruit in the state of California and went overlooked by most of the in-state powers, committing to Washington over Arizona State, Boise State and Utah. Burr-Kirven accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game, but later pulled out.","Strong key and diagnose skills…tracks the football well and it isn’t a coincidence that he is always in the vicinity…technically-form tackler…comes to balance on the move and squares up to stop ballcarriers cold…physical through the hole…sidesteps blockers without losing sight of the football…nice job reading passing concepts and following the vision of the quarterback…top academic performer, earning the 2018 Pac-12 football Scholar Athlete of the Year…graduated with a 3.69 GPA and a degree in cinema studies (December 2018)…non-stop hustler…elite tackle production as a senior, leading the FBS with 176 stops.","Small-framed player with a maxed out build…lack of length hinders his ability to stack-and-shed blocks…bullied when working near the line of scrimmage…adequate straight-line speed, but lacks burst in his movements or when redirecting…false steps signal his exit from the play…tight vs. man, limiting his coverage range…inconsistent depth in his zone drops.","A two-year starter at Washington, Burr-Kirven played both inside and outside in the Huskies 3-3-5 base scheme, also playing on special teams coverages. His FBS-best 176 tackles in 2018 was the most by a UW defender since 1987, collecting double-digit stops in 12 of 14 games. With below-average size/length and average on-field athleticism, Burr-Kirven has a small margin of error as a run defender and will need to be protected in coverage. Despite his lack of measurables, he gets the most out of his ability and leaves it all on the field, using accurate pursuit angles and relentless energy to make plays. Overall, Burr-Kirven has some scheme limitations, but there is a place in the NFL for his blend of instincts and aggressive play, projecting as a key subpackage player and special teamer.","4th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,176,5.5,2,4,8,2,31.875,8.875,74.375,4.56,2.67,1.55,34.5,121,4.09,6.85,21

Due to the long commute (Winton Woods is north of Cincinnati), he often lived with an assistant coach during the week. As a senior, he recorded 110 tackles, 16.0 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks to earn All-State Honorable Mention honors. Ranked as a top-50 recruit in the state of Ohio, Long considered offers from Kentucky, Louisville and Cincinnati before choosing West Virginia. His father (David Sr.) is a former heavyweight boxer. Long elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.

He led the team in tackles (111), tackles for loss (19.0) and sacks (8.0) in 2018 and was the only player in the FBS to rank top-30 nationally in all three categories. Long is a see-ball, get-ball defender who flies around the field and thrives on his aggressive nature, which is both a positive and negative. In coverage, he is highly active, but doesn’t compete with the same play speed or confidence. Overall, Long is quick to diagnose, trigger and attack, but his lack of length and inconsistent breakdown skills make him an unreliable open-field tackler and lowers his NFL ceiling, projecting as a backup and special teamer.","4th-5th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,111,19,8,1,4,0,30.75,10,75.5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,18

Egbule has a terrific blend of size, length and athletic ability, and he can see the entire field. While he shows the ability to key and diagnose, he needs to process the action quicker and improve his anticipation.

Not ranked among the top-300 recruits in the state of Florida, Hanks flirted with a few SEC programs, but no offers materialized, and he committed to New Mexico State over Appalachian State. He moved to linebacker shortly after he joined the Aggies. Hanks’ older brother (Allen Edwards) played defensive end at Pittsburgh (2015-17). Hanks accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Body beautiful with a shredded physique…broad shoulders, long arms and huge wingspan…strong acceleration and play speed…magnet to the ball due to his backfield vision…fills quickly and powerful through gaps, loading up behind his pads to create stopping power at contact…transfers the momentum from his pursuit speed into his tackles…makes plays from the backside and as a blitzer (43.0 career tackles for loss)…obviously dedicates himself in the weight room…highly productive career, finishing with the fourth-most tackles (396) in school history…accounted for 14 turnovers in his career (eight interceptions, six forced fumbles).","Stiff hips and ankles, hindering his change of direction and breakdown movements…elusive ballcarriers will give him trouble in space…inconsistent take-on skills and struggles to keep his feet underneath him…stuck on blocks and late to shed…too reactive in coverage and doesn’t anticipate throwing lanes…hands- on in man coverage and attracts flags…missed three games as a senior due to an ankle sprain (September 2018); also missed off-season practices due to shoulder surgery (January 2016) and wrist surgery (January 2018).","A four-year starter at New Mexico State, Hanks made the safety-to-linebacker transition for the Aggies and lined up as the SAM linebacker in Frank Spaziani’s 4-3 base scheme.

He isn’t a trustworthy cover defender at this point in his development.

With his degree in hand, Smith accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Terrific body control and dip off the edge…smooth sink in his plant-and-go to make sharp 90-degree turns (best 3-cone time at the combine among front-seven defenders)…active hands in his rush to fight off jabs…quickly finds his speed in pursuit…physical tackler and strikes with violence…competes with boundless energy…recorded two blocks on special teams and scored four touchdowns the last two seasons (three fumble returns, one punt block return)…graduated with a degree in communications (December 2018)…committed to his craft with an intense work ethic…remarkable backfield production the last two seasons, becoming the first player in school history to twice earn First Team All-American honors.","Undersized for regular pass rush work in the NFL…lacks the edge speed or length to routinely win the corner vs. pro tackles…doesn’t have the body strength to force his way through gaps…struggles in the run game vs. power and too easily engulfed or moved from his spot…relies more on effort than technical skill…unproven dropping into coverage…position fit concerns and will require time adjusting to new responsibilities.","A two-year starter at Northern Illinois, Smith was the boundary rush end in the Huskies’ hybrid four-man front, usually standing up off the edge. Over the past two seasons, he combined for 54.0 tackles for loss, 29.0 sacks and seven forced fumbles, ranking near the top nationally in both categories in 2017 and 2018. Smith used his short-area quickness, aggressive hands and motor to feast against MAC tackles, but it will be a different story vs. NFL tackles and he will need to prove he can handle coverage responsibilities to carve out a role. Lacking ideal size, length and power, his issues at the point-of-attack and in the run game will require him to play in space. Overall, Smith is the type of prospect you don’t want to bet against, however, his NFL future will look different than what made him productive in college, projecting as an off-ball linebacker, situational pass rusher and special teamer.","5th-6th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,56,24.5,15,4,1,0,30.75,9,73.5,4.69,2.78,1.72,31.5,118,4.32,6.75,25

He ran sprints and relays with personal-bests in the 100-meters (10.93) and 200-meters (22.10). Lewis played both ways for Eastlake, rushing for 1,200 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior, adding 45 tackles and two interceptions as a safety on defense. Recruited mostly as a defensive player, he was the No. 11 recruit in the state of Washington in the 2014 class and committed to the Huskies over Arizona State and Pittsburgh. Lewis was part of Chris Petersen’s first recruiting class at Washington, but never played in a game there. He redshirted in 2014 and was dismissed from the program prior to the 2015 season for a violation of team rules. He resurfaced at Coffeyville Community College, playing in just five games in 2015 due to injury. Lewis was hoping to rejoin a power-five program and Colorado gave him that chance (Utah State and Memphis were his only other offers). His twin brother (Troy, who is six minutes younger)                                                                                       was a preferred walk-on for the Buffs in 2016; his older brother (Ryan) played cornerback at Pittsburgh (went undrafted in 2017) and saw action for the Buffalo Bills in 2018; his father (Will) played cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks and spent 20 years as a NFL scout and personnel man (was most recently the general manager of the AAF’s Memphis Express); he has several other family members who played professionally, including his cousin (Louis Riddick), who played six years in the NFL and is currently an ESPN analyst. Lewis accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Top-tier athlete with lower body explosion…above-average speed to make plays at both sidelines…nimble feet to slip blocks or capture the corner as a blitzer…able to dip, loop and beat blocks as an edge rusher…strong hands to quickly corral and ground the ballcarrier…decleats runners with his lead shoulder…opens his hips to drop and cover ground vs. the pass…experienced on special teams coverages…grew up around the game with unique family bloodlines…started at inside linebacker before moving outside as a senior.","Point-of-attack strength is below-average…can be controlled and turned by tight ends…needs to sort things quicker with inconsistent sightlines…needs to mature his play anticipation to beat blockers to the spot…needs to improve his break down and wrap skills as an open-field tackler…doesn’t play mechanically- sound with his hands… was dismissed from Washington (July 2015) for a violation of team rules (an example of why going to school close to home can be a negative influence).","A two-year starter at Colorado, Lewis was an inside linebacker in the Buffaloes’ 3-4 base as a junior before moving outside as a senior, which was a bumpy transition. He finished as one of only four CU defenders with 650-plus snaps in 2018, also spending extensive time on special teams. Lewis, who has football in his blood, boasts four-down experience and leans on his blend of speed and striking skills to make plays. He tends to get out-muscled near the line of scrimmage and needs to eliminate the inconsistencies that followed him on each tape. Overall, Lewis needs to mature his diagnose and take-on skills, but his explosive athleticism is the main attraction here, projecting as a potential backup at WILL and immediate contributor on special teams.","6th",.,12,6,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,66,6,2,0,5,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

As a senior, he threw for 714 yards, rushed for 921 yards and scored 25 total touchdowns (nine passing, 16 rushing), earning the Utah High School Most Valuable Player Award. He also saw time on defense, mostly at safety where he recorded 52 tackles and one interception. Elliss hoped to played quarterback collegiately at Utah (his parents alma mater), but Idaho was his only FBS-level scholarship offer and that was a grayshirt opportunity (Idaho moved to the FCS-level in 2017). He moved to defense in college and played a variety of linebacker roles for the Vandals. Elliss’ father (Luther) was a consensus All-American defensive tackle at Utah in 1994 and was a first-rounder (No. 20 overall) in the 1995 NFL Draft, playing 10 seasons in the NFL (nine for the Detroit Lions). He was the team chaplain for the Denver Broncos before serving as the Idaho defensive line coach the past two seasons. Elliss’ mother (Rebecca) was a swimmer at Utah. His younger brother (Christian) plays linebacker at Idaho and led the team in tackles in 2018. Elliss married former Idaho basketball player (Brooke Reilly) in the summer of 2018.","Energetic athlete…field fast with bursts of momentum, both immediate and when closing…uses speed to win the edge, shave the corner and affect the pocket…fluid lower body to sink and redirect…aggressive punch to create knock-back at contact…sets a hard edge in the run game…forceful tackler and arrives with thump…improved zone drops with speed to stick with backs or tight ends in man-coverage…intense competitive nature with a relentless play style…four-year starter with experience all over the front-seven.","Needs to improve his efficiency scraping and keeping his balance off blocks…inconsistent leverage and hand use when attacking blocks…tends to lose sight of the ballcarrier once engaged…always in a hurry and needs to be more conniving in pursuit…arrives too hot and doesn’t consistently calm his feet and break down as a tackler, leading to mistakes…average instincts, relying more on effort as a see-ball, get-ball defender…lacks nuance as an edge rusher and needs to develop his pass rush moves.","A four-year starter at Idaho, Elliss bounced between inside (MLB) and outside linebacker (SAM) over his career, lining up mostly as the “BUCK” pass rusher as a senior. He had never played the linebacker position before Idaho, but quickly adapted and was asked to do a little bit of everything over his career. Elliss is a quick read/react player with the play personality and raw athleticism that leads to production. While he plays with urgency, his anticipation isn’t NFL-ready and he                                                                                     [166]  often finds himself out-of-control taking on blocks or finishing.

He was a three-year starter at linebacker and recorded 193 tackles, 42.5 tackles for loss and 21.5 sacks, earning Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior. Takitaki was also a bruiser at running back and totaled 1,673 rushing yards (7.1 average) and 25 touchdowns over his final two prep seasons. He was recruited for offense and defense and committed to BYU as a linebacker over offers from Arizona, Washington State and Wisconsin. Takitaki came off the bench his first two seasons, but ran into off-field issues and multiple suspensions, redshirting in 2016. He stayed out of trouble and developed into the team’s top defensive player the last two seasons. Takitaki married his wife (Alyssa, former BYU swimmer) in June 2016. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game and was a late addition to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Mirrors well vs. the run with his backfield vision and pursuit speed…bursts into blockers with a sharp punch to stun and unwind…doesn’t shy from contact, fighting and clawing to get ballcarriers on the ground…bursts downhill and recorded more tackles for loss (32.5) than starts (27) over his career…makes the playbook come alive with his aggressive motor…experienced at multiple positions in the front-seven…senior captain and rebuilt his image into a veteran leader over his collegiate career.","Tweener body type…poor patience and tends to attack before reading, leading to wasted movements and miscalculated angles…makes a lot of plays, but he is also responsible for a lot of “almost” tackles on his tape…inconsistent setting the edge…tightness through his hips and core, delaying his redirect…late to recognize passing patterns and his comfort level in coverage is low…multiple suspensions throughout his first three seasons at BYU, including missing the second half of the 2015 season after he was charged with misdemeanor theft (August 2015) for stealing BYU athletic equipment while working as a custodian (took a plea deal); he then redshirted in 2016 and spent the year away from football…also missed time due to fighting and missing team events.","A two-year starter at BYU, Takitaki started his Cougars’ career as a pass rusher before moving to a stand-up role as a senior, starting the first half of the 2018 season at WILL and the second half at the MIKE position. Needing only one tackle to reach triple digits in the 2018 bowl game, he set a career-best with 19 tackles in his final collegiate game. Takitaki had a tough time living up to the school’s strict honor code, but he credits his wife for turning his life around. While he improved his discipline off the field, his on-field discipline requires maturing, relying more on crazed effort than instincts or technique. Overall, Takitaki has tweener traits that make his scheme fit tough to project at the next level, but he flips a switch and competes with terrific play speed, which will give him a chance to earn a role on special teams while he finds his footing on defense.","6th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,118,9,3,1,3,0,32,9.625,75.375,4.63,2.7,1.6,37,125,4.28,7.21,24

He finished his senior season with 14 touchdowns and no interceptions, but Eden Prairie was a run-heavy offense that focused on him handing the ball to a stable of backs. Connelly was also a three-year letterman in lacrosse, which kept him from attending too many football camps. As a recruit, he didn’t have any Division-I offers and jumped at the only opportunity he received (walk-on spot at Wisconsin) over playing Division II or III in Minnesota. Connelly didn’t have any delusions about playing quarterback in the Big Ten and added 30 pounds to his frame, forcing a move to linebacker on the scout team. He impressed enough during his redshirt year to earn a scholarship prior to the 2015 season. Midway through his senior year, Connelly found out that his mother (Christi) was diagnosed with lung cancer and he is now involved in raising money for cancer research. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game, but was unable to play due to injury.","Quick read/react skills…breaks down plays quickly, giving himself a head start…plays with burst to the football…speed looks the same on every snap and is enough to make plays at the sideline…finds a way to harmonize his discipline and aggression, using both as assets…violent play style and looks to drive through his target…played through a core/abdominal injury as a senior…graduated with a degree in economics (December 2018)…former walk-on and didn’t take long to earn a scholarship…coaches say he has a relentless commitment to his craft.","Below-average arm length with inconsistent take-on skills…spends too much time attached to blocks…late to win body position and can be redirected by tight ends…slight body tightness shows when attempting to tackle in space…average pursuit skills with little chance of recovery after a misstep…appears robotic when opening his hips in coverage…injured his core/abdominal muscles during the summer prior to his senior year and played through it as long as he could, undergoing surgery (December 2018) and missing the Bowl Game and Shrine Game.","A three-year starter at Wisconsin, Connelly morphed from walk-on quarterback to linebacker in Madison, lining up inside in the Badgers’ 3-4 base scheme. He out-worked more highly-recruited players when he arrived at Wisconsin and will out-work higher drafted players when he lands in an NFL training camp. Connelly competes like a lifelong linebacker, not a former quarterback, and has the competitive toughness required for NFL life. While he plays assignment sound, his stack/shed skills are undeveloped with straight-linish athleticism.

Allen was the No. 100 recruit in the state of Texas and received offers from Kansas State, Oklahoma, TCU and Texas Tech, committing to the Red Raiders. After redshirting in 2014, he was a key piece of the Tech defense in 2015. However, he was arrested during the 2016 offseason on a second-degree felony count of burglary of a habitation and subsequently dismissed from the program. Allen enrolled at East Mississippi Community College for the 2016 season where he was featured on the Netflix original series “Last Chance U.” He was given the opportunity to return to Texas Tech in June 2017. Allen’s father (Keith) was a running back at the University of Texas. Allen received an invitation to the 2019 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, but declined.","Quick to key, read and diagnose vs. the run, understanding blocking schemes…quick feet and lateral slide to avoid blocks…sees through bodies and doesn’t lose sight of the ball…determined chaser with adequate range for the position…calms his feet and surges into his targets to create physical tackles…tracks the eyes of the quarterback and sniffs out screens…two-year team captain and battled back from self-created adversity…well-liked by his teammates and coaches (former Texas Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury: “He’s been great for our program”).","Overaggressive and prematurely attacks the line of scrimmage…plays with decent speed, but lacks the make-up burst to offset missteps…tends to flow with blockers and abandon gaps…tight-hipped when attempting to work off blocks or quickly adjust his angles…occasionally dropped into zones on tape, but not a playmaker in coverage…marginal ball skills…battled injuries as a senior, including a broken hand and sprained left knee (November 2018)…arrested and charged with second-degree felony burglary after he broke into a home (December 2018) and stole several items, including guns, which he sold (charges were later dropped after he completed a diversion program).","A three-year starter at Texas Tech, Allen was the starting WILL linebacker and a three-down player in David Gibbs’ 4-2-5 base. From his immature mistake to avoiding jail time and regaining the trust of everyone around him, his story of redemption will likely have a positive effect on the rest of his life. Allen does a nice job downhill, finding the gap, working off contact and throwing his nose in the fire. He competes with an ultracompetitive play personality, but his overaggressive style will work against him.

Hansen was named the Utah Gatorade Player of the Year and a Parade All-American. He was also part of the school’s boys’ basketball state championship in 2011. He was recruited hard by the two main programs in the state: BYU and Utah. Despite family ties to BYU, he committed to Utah as a quarterback. After redshirting in 2012, Hansen left the program for a two-year religious mission in Brisbane, Australia. He returned for the 2015 season and split his time at quarterback and safety. Hansen moved to defense full-time in 2016, playing primarily at safety until the 2018 season when he moved to linebacker. His father (Brian), uncle (Bruce) and cousin (Colby) all played football at BYU, although he did have another uncle (Randy) who lettered on Utah’s football team (1968-70).

Johnson enrolled at Dodge City Community College and combined for 215 tackles and 11.5 sacks in his two seasons, earning All-Conference honors both years. He was the No. 1 JUCO linebacker recruit and wished to return to the south, initially committing to Alabama (his “dream school”). However, Johnson was forced to decommit and look elsewhere due to class requirement issues that kept him from transferring to the SEC. He narrowed his choice to Arizona State and Texas, committing to the Longhorns. Johnson has two infant children (a boy and a girl) under one-year old.","“Wow” speed and flies around the field like a safety…quick to read/react, accelerating in a blink…above-average closing burst as a tackler…knows when to roll the dice, timing his blitzes to shoot gaps before blockers can recover…plus range and covers ground…smooth pedal and footwork when asked to play in reverse…violent play style and competes with the relentless mentality required...big voice in the locker room.","Small-framed defender with below-average length…poor functional strength and too easily controlled by blockers…late to find his balance as a tackler, falling off ballcarriers…wild strike zone as a striker…tight and reactive in coverage, struggling to challenge throws…poor ball production and misses opportunities to make plays in the air…suspended for one game as a senior (November 2018) for a violation of team rules.","A two-year starter at Texas, Johnson played the “Rover” linebacker position as a senior in Todd Orlando’s 3-3-5 base scheme, filling the void left by Malik Jefferson. His background raises several character questions, although his Texas teammates and coaches speak highly of his vocal leadership in Austin. Johnson unlocks his hips and instantly accelerates, flying all over the field with an attacking mindset. While he plays a violent style of football, he struggles to disengage from blocks and his overaggressive tendencies lead to mistakes. Overall, there isn’t a passive bone in Johnson’s body and he always seems to be in the vicinity of the ball due to his play speed, but his lack of strength, discipline and cover skills put a low ceiling on his NFL future.","PFA",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,90,16.5,6.5,2,1,0,31.25,10.25,76,4.43,2.63,1.6,33.5,121,4.57,7.15,16

Lamar was the No. 7 recruit in the state of Georgia and No. 58 nationally, receiving scholarship offers from every team in the southeast. He spurned offers from Alabama, Auburn and in-state Georgia to sign with Clemson. His uncle (Anthony Butts) was a defensive tackle in the late ‘80s at Mississippi State and was a 10th-round pick in the 1989 NFL Draft to the Denver Broncos.

Despite ranking 10th on the team in defensive snaps in 2018, he finished second on the team in tackles as a junior. Lamar appears intimidating in pads, but doesn’t play as strong as he looks and lacks ideal violence for downhill work. While he has adequate straight-line speed, his rigid movements in space limit how teams will use him in the NFL. Overall, Lamar competes with NFL toughness and effort, but he is a stiff athlete with inconsistent physicality, which clouds his NFL projection.

His best season came as a senior, finishing second on the team with 96 tackles. Harris attacks blocks with a head of steam and a violent, upward punch, although he tends to prematurely attack gaps, making it easier for offensive linemen to engage and slow his pursuit. He breaks down well as a tackler in the hole, finding his balance to wrap and finish. While his range is best described as average, he looks comfortable dropping with smooth hip-turn to change directions and pursue.

He landed at Akron and was a three-year starter (tied the school-record with 51 games played), moving from WILL to SAM (overhang) linebacker as a senior. Gilbert is a small-framed player with narrow shoulders and average functional power, getting eaten up near the line of scrimmage. He is an elite speed athlete in pursuit with the lower body twitch to redirect and chase. However, his lack of length and finishing strength result in too many “almost” tackles on tape.

Gifford battled a hip injury as an underclassman, including surgery (November 2017), which ended his junior season. He returned strong as a senior captain and had a career year under the new coaching staff. Gifford was at his best as an upfield player, showing off his speed to the edge and pass rush intensity. He competes with the aggressive nature required to set a hard edge and do battle in the trenches. He plays mentally alert, but his anticipation lacks development, which also shows in coverage.

He finished 11th in the FBS in tackles in 2018 and took home MWC Defensive Player of the Year honors. Allison is an eager run defender with reliable breakdown and finish skills, targeting the hip and driving through his target as a tackler. He has the foot quickness to avoid climbing blockers, but he struggles to shed once blockers latch on. He isn’t as comfortable in reverse and bites hard on play fakes, taking wasted steps.

Akins is physical vs. the run with a highly competitive appetite, beating blockers to the spot and arriving with thump. He is a strong tackler, wrapping and finishing through his hips. He does his best work in a straight line and lacks the change of direction skills or coverage awareness to hold up in space. However, he picks things up quickly and coaches rave about his football acumen, also showing a strong sense of teamwork and devotion to a team (plans to join the military after the NFL).

His best season came as a sophomore before inconsistent junior and senior seasons (ruled academically ineligible for the 2018 bowl game, missing his final game). Jones is an above-average space athlete, flashing initial burst and range to make plays at both sidelines. His intensity is a plus, but his hot-headed style will backfire and lead to undisciplined mistakes. He is often caught guessing, attacking before diagnosing and creating wasted steps.

Alaka is a physical run defender who attacks holes with power, also showing excellent timing as an A-gap blitzer. He is quick to read/react, but he trusts his eyes to a fault, taking the cheese and not anticipating play fakes. While he has adequate pursuit speed, he can be frozen by shifty ballcarriers in the open field and his tape shows wasted steps in coverage.

UTSA has produced only two seasons in school history with a 100-plus tackle defender and both belong to Tauaefa. It is easy to love his energy and tackling mechanics, squaring, wrapping and finishing through his target.

Hall has natural “leadership qualities,” according to his coaches, and competes with the relentless nature required, aggressively taking on blocks and exploding at contact as a tackler. However, he is often late to key-and- diagnose, creating road blocks and lacking the make-up speed to close the gap in pursuit.

Davis has a unique feel for angles to find the quickest route to the ball, staying low and controlled as a wrap tackler to finish. He has a strong understanding of situations and gets his teammates lined up correctly pre-snap. While he shows quality run fits, his lack of outside range can be the difference between a one-yard gain and a six-yard gain and he would often come off the field on obvious passing downs.

Overall, Ya-Sin is a late bloomer and doesn’t have elite long-speed for the position, but he stays dialed in with his eyes in the right place and shows outstanding competitive toughness, projecting best in a zone-heavy scheme.","1st-2nd",26,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,47,2,0,0,14,2,32,9.875,77.375,4.51,2.65,1.6,39.5,120,4.31,7.31,18

He played both ways as a wide receiver and cornerback, but was better known for his offensive output, posting 51 catches for 873 yards and school-record 10 touchdowns as a senior. Bunting earned Honorable Mention All-State honors as a senior captain and led Chippewa Valley to the 2014 district championship. He was recruited by Division-II programs like Ferris State, Saginaw Valley State and Northwood, but wanted to play Division-I and Central Michigan came through with an offer a month before signing day. However, when Dan Enos resigned his post as head coach, Bunting was left in limbo. On signing day, he was set to sign with Saginaw Valley State, but held off and took one more run at Central Michigan. He visited new head coach John Bonamego, who offered him the opportunity to grayshirt. Bunting spent the 2015 football season helping at his high school and officially enrolled in January 2016. He spent time practicing at safety and wide receiver before moving to cornerback full-time during his freshman year. Bunting chose to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Agile-footed athlete with swivel hips and balanced start/stop quickness…long-speed to recover and carry receivers vertically…above-average height/length for the position…matches up well vs. size on the outside…competes at the catch point and does receiver-like things in coverage…always ball searching…anticipates route breaks and recognizes play indicators…gets physical early in the down and takes pride in playing chippy…serviceable run defender…his coaches say he embraces leadership roles.","Skinny limbs and lacks ideal body mass…marginal play strength and spends too much time hung up on blocks…impatient feet in press, allowing receivers to immediately gain a step…wasn’t asked to backpedal in CMU’s scheme…flexible body type, but tends to play upright in off-coverage instead of using his sink to drive…plays the man downfield, but can be late to find the ball…hands-on mentality will lead to flags.                                                                                          [179]","A two-year starter at Central Michigan, Bunting lined up at left cornerback for the Chippewas, playing both press-man and zone coverages. He recorded multiple interceptions in each of his three seasons, adding several impact plays on special teams, including a blocked punt and 60-yard scoop-and-score after a blocked field goal. Bunting has the athleticism to run better routes than the receiver and although his undisciplined mechanics lead to mistakes, he is usually in position to recover. Despite his thin build, he competes with a cover-and-clobber mentality throughout the lifespan of the route and can eliminate the mismatch advantage larger pass-catchers usually have vs. cornerbacks. Overall, Bunting needs to get stronger and become a more technically-sound player, but he plays loose and suffocates the catch point, projecting as borderline starter as a rookie and full-time starter in year two.","1st-2nd",29,12,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,37,3,0,2,7,2,31.75,9.625,76.75,4.42,2.59,1.51,41.5,126,.,.,14

He also ran track and earned all-state honors in the 200- and 400-meter dash in 2014. Baker wasn’t ranked among the top-50 recruits in the state of Florida, but he received plenty of interest, turning down offers from schools like Alabama, Clemson and Texas to sign with Georgia (his dream school). He grew up in the crime-stricken Liberty City community in northwest Miami, but his parents provided a structured environment and kept him focused on football and education. Baker’s father (Andre) helped instill a strong work ethic in him at a young age. He skipped the Sugar Bowl and declined his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Coordinated movement skills at the snap and downfield…stays a step ahead due to his above-average instincts and route recognition…sits on patterns and stays dialed in to click-and-close or carry receivers vertically…aggressively uses the sideline and gets physical in coverage…uses his length to work around receivers and fight through their hands…coaches will love what he brings in run support, arriving with thump and competing with terrific finish…doesn’t allow himself to be bullied by blockers…quiet and introverted by nature, but plays confident and grew as a leader in college (former Georgia DC Mel Tucker: “He works really hard in practice, he’s developed in the meeting room, he’s emerged as a leader for us.”)","Only average long speed for the position, lacking secondary jets to easily recover…desire to bait can lead to spacing issues…will attract attention from officials for his grabbing downfield…has a few personal foul penalties on his tape for late hits…tackling technique comes and goes, occasionally using his shoulder or attempting to hug-and-throw…prematurely opens his hips, giving up inside position too easily…lacks much jam experience…doesn’t have extensive experience as an inside cornerback…perceived lax demeanor will be a turn off for some coaches.","A three-year starter at Georgia, Baker lined up primarily at right cornerback and put together a strong senior season, becoming the first UGA player to win the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back. He is attempting to become the first Georgia cornerback drafted in the first round since 1999 (Champ Bailey). Baker’s tape shows the quickness, fluidity and instincts to play in both zone and man coverage, along with the toughness to make plays in run support. His hands-on approach is one of his best qualities, but you must live with the other side of the sword too, as his aggressive nature will lead to penalties or mistakes. Overall, Baker isn’t an elite size/speed prospect, but he shows the innate ability to diagnose routes and put himself in position to make plays, projecting as an NFL starter, ideally suited in a cover-2 scheme.","1st-2nd",34,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,40,2,0,1,12,2,32,9,77.125,4.52,2.63,1.6,.,118,.,.,14

A three-year starter, he finished his career with 107 catches for 2,155 yards and 30 touchdowns, also returning three punts for scores as a senior. On defense, Layne accounted for seven interceptions his junior year. He was also a four-year letterman as a point guard on the basketball team and a standout on the track team, advancing to states in the 400-meters and placed eighth in the long jump (22.5’) at state championships. Layne was the No. 36 wide receiver recruit in the country and a top-10 player in the state of Ohio, committing to Michigan State over Alabama, Notre Dame and Ohio State. He signed as a wide receiver, but moved to cornerback early in his true freshman season. Layne decided to skip his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft, skipping the bowl game.","Tall, long frame…accelerates to his top speed to stay on top of routes or quickly recover…maintains his balance out of his transition to mirror different types of receivers…natural timing and ball skills and reacts to the ball like a former wide receiver…fearless jumping routes…better feel for getting his head turned to                                                                                     [180]  track the football…improved instincts as a junior with a better understanding of route concepts…extends well in press…competitive tackler and gets his man on the ground…tied for the most passes defended (16) in the Big Ten in 2018.","Leggy gait…tends to play on his heels, causing him to be a tick late driving on in-breaking or underneath routes…not at the point of his development where he fully trusts his technique…has some man-cover limitations as sudden route runners will be able to create separation…questionable play strength and spends too much time attached to blockers.","A three-year starter at Michigan State, Layne played primarily in the boundary in press-man and zone coverage for the Spartans. He arrived in East Lansing as a wideout, but made the move to defense early in his true freshman season and played both ways at different points in his MSU career, catching one pass for 11 yards. Layne took a sizeable step with his key-and-diagnose skills this past season, aiding his innate ability to judge and disrupt the catch point. He has the calm feet and athletic movements to shadow routes, but inconsistent footwork forces him to surrender separation at the break point. Overall, Layne needs continued reps at corner to improve his technique and spacing, but he can mirror-and-match from press-coverage and has outstanding ball skills, projecting as an eventual NFL starter.","2nd",40,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,72,2.5,0.5,0,16,1,33,9.25,80.125,4.5,2.65,1.59,37.5,134,4.09,6.9,.

He led the team to back-to-back Class 5A State Championships his junior and senior years, earning All-State honors both seasons. As a senior, Love posted 92 tackles, 19.0 tackles for loss and three forced fumbles, adding 1,067 rushing yards, 662 receiving yards and 25 offensive touchdowns. He was the No. 46 cornerback recruit in the 2016 class and received mostly Big Ten offers (Iowa, Illinois, Northwestern) until Notre Dame (his dream school) offered, committing as a junior. Love’s father (D.T.) played college basketball and his younger brother (Michael) was a part of the Northern Illinois 2019 recruiting class as a running back. Love elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Outstanding agility…coordinated pedal to smoothly transition and stay on the same plane vertically…quick to diagnose routes and sort out what he sees…unlocks his hips to drive on throws…instinctively tracks the ball downfield…trustworthy to compete when the ball is in the air…outstanding ball production with 44 passes defended in 34 career starts…accurately reads the eyes/movements of receivers to make plays with his back to the ball…doesn’t lack for toughness as a run defender…offensive background shows with the ball in his hands, averaging 31.8 yards per interception return (5/159/2)…his extensive film study and detailed preparation are clear on game day…low-key personality and allows his play to do the talking.","Questionable long-speed for the position, struggling to close the gap once receivers gain a step…lacks burst in his movements, struggling to easily recover after a misstep…undersized by NFL standards and his lack of inches are obvious vs. bigger receivers (see 2018 Stanford tape)…inexperienced jamming or disrupting routes…too easily moved by blockers and removed from the run game…too many shoe-string tackle attempts on his film…missed most of the Cotton Bowl after failing the concussion protocol (December 2018).","A three-year starter at Notre Dame, Love played primarily in the boundary in the Irish’s man-heavy scheme, moving inside in nickel situations. He was among the FBS leaders in passes defended each of the last two seasons, breaking the school record with 44 career passes defended. Although his recovery athleticism is a concern, Love plays with balanced footwork to mirror routes, gain positioning and make plays with his elite-level ball skills. He trusts his eyes and instincts and won’t panic, but his lack of length is evident vs. large-framed targets. Overall, Love’s lack of ideal size, speed and suddenness will be tougher to mask vs. NFL receivers, but his velvet feet, intelligence and ball skills are the type of traits worth betting on, projecting best in the nickel.","2nd",50,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,63,3,0,0,17,1,31.75,9,75.375,4.54,2.65,1.62,36,121,4.1,6.72,14

He transferred from Father Ryan (private school) to Hendersonville (public school) for his senior season due to proximity, but was ruled ineligible due to state transfer rules. Despite not playing in 2015, Williams was rated as the No. 2 recruit in the state of Tennessee and received scholarship offers from every SEC program, electing to stay close to home at Vanderbilt. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Giant-sized for the position with outstanding height and length…quick-footed and flexible…smoothly opens his gait to stay attached to receivers in his transition…stays busy as a run defender, understanding field leverage and flashing a closing burst to drive-and-finish…hard-nosed, hug tackler…uses his physicality to pin receivers, post up and clobber at the catch point…uses his length to crowd targets, leading the SEC in passes defended (18) in 2018…started every game the last two seasons.","Only average speed and will lose foot races on vertical routes…messy mechanics and savvy route runners force his hips the wrong way…impatient in press, giving up inside position with hard outside sets…driven off the top of routes due to his sidesaddle technique, opening up stop/comeback patterns…plays nose- to-nose in press, but shows inconsistent jam skills and doesn’t use enough contact to disrupt the infancy of routes…inconsistent ball awareness with his back turned to the football…too many “almost” tackles on his resume.","A two-year starter at Vanderbilt, Williams was the Commodores’ boundary cornerback the last two seasons, playing primarily press and off-man coverage. Few cornerbacks tower over wideouts like Williams, who has imposing size and length for the position, with the athleticism to pattern-match. His natural talent and aggressive mentality immediately pop on tape, but so does his lack of technical skill and spatial awareness, leaving him unbalanced downfield and out of position (the 2018 Georgia tape specifically shows the reasons to be both excited and concerned about his talent).

As a senior, he recorded 25 catches for 525 yards and seven touchdowns on offense, adding 19 tackles, six passes defended and one interception on defense. Long was named a U.S. Army All-American and was the No. 7 cornerback recruit in the nation. He initially committed to Stanford during his senior season before backing off that pledge and choosing Michigan over Washington.

His college production was underwhelming, but he wasn’t routinely challenged on tape. Long plays nose-to-nose in press with the lateral slide to match releases and attach himself to patterns, staying balanced with his punch and transition. While patient at the line, he tends to panic, grip and grab at the top of routes and can be manipulated by savvy receivers. Overall, Long needs to develop a more disciplined approach with his reads and contact downfield, but he is a composed athlete with hip fluidity and physical mentality, projecting best in the nickel.","2nd-3rd",72,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,17,0,0,0,9,1,30.875,9.625,76.125,4.45,2.62,1.57,39.5,120,3.97,6.45,15

On the football field, Dean started earning major college offers his junior season, first by Ohio State, then followed by Mississippi State, Miami and Florida. He committed to the Buckeyes, but suffered a torn ACL and meniscus towards the end of the 2013 high school season. Dean returned healthy for his senior year in 2014, but tore the same meniscus again in the season finale. He graduated early and enrolled at Ohio State in January 2015, but the school’s medical staff did not clear him for participation. Ohio State offered him a medical hardship to stay on academic scholarship, but Dean wasn’t ready to give up on playing football and received a second (and more favorable) opinion from Dr. James Andrews. He enrolled at Auburn over the summer and joined the football team, sitting out the 2015 season as a transfer student. Dean suffered another serious knee injury prior to the 2016 season.

He suffered three major knee injuries prior to his first collegiate game, but the only contest he missed the last two seasons was due to a shoulder issue. Although not a sudden player, Dean is balanced in his transition with above-average speed to match the vertical stretch of receivers. He needs to improve his decisiveness from zone coverage and doesn’t play with the desired competitive mean streak for press-man work.

Mullen is a tall, leggy corner and moves with the fluidity to stay attached with any type of receiver. He is still a novice fundamentally, both with his transition and diagnose skills, and needs to develop a better feel for route breaks.

He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Outstanding size and length for the position…not shy using his long arms mid-route…understands how to use the sideline to pin receivers…well-versed with route combinations to stay in shadow position from off coverage…senses rub routes and stays clean…good drive quickness to click-and-close…productive on paper with 30 career passes defended despite only starting his senior year…graduated with two degrees: telecommunications (December 2017) and broadcast journalism (December 2018)…mentally tough to move on from mistakes.","Balance issues were a constant on each game tape…uncontrolled lower body mid-transition, losing his footing…okay speed, but doesn’t have the juice to closes the gap once the receiver gains a step…doesn’t consistently turn to find the ball…needs to make the plays that are there — reads it, but either not in position or drops the interception…too passive fighting through blocks…off-balanced open-field tackler…overly conservative in run defense and not always interested in making the tackle…only one season as the full-time starter and lacks experience inside vs. the slot.","A one-year starter at Penn State, Oruwariye saw his playing time gradually increase each season in Happy Valley, lining up primarily in the boundary as a senior. After leading the team in interceptions as a junior, he posted a team-best 15 passes defended in 2018, which ranked third-best in the Big Ten. Oruwariye passes the eye test and shows natural judgement skills to make plays on the ball. He needs to iron out his inconsistencies (vs. the pass and the run) to stay atop an NFL depth chart. Overall, Oruwariye checks two important boxes with his length and intelligence, but his average speed and inability to maintain his balance in coverage likely limits him to a zone-based scheme.","3rd-4th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,51,2,0,1,15,3,31.375,9,75.25,4.47,2.66,1.63,36.5,120,4.16,6.82,17

He was named the Gatorade Track & Field Athlete of the Year as a junior at Thurgood Marshall after winning the 110-meter high hurdles (13.63) and 300-meter intermediate hurdles (36.34). Sheffield repeated as the 110-meter champion as a senior (13.44), which almost set the state record (13.40). He continued running track in college, setting the Ohio State indoor record in the 60-meter dash (6.663). While track brought more accolades, Sheffield says his first love is football. As a senior at Thurgood Marshall, he posted 39 tackles, nine passes defended, two interceptions and three blocked field goals. Sheffield was the No. 4 cornerback in the 2015 recruiting class, ranking as the No. 3 player in Texas (behind Malik Jefferson and Daylon Mack) and the No. 20 player overall. He could have signed with any college program in the country and eventually signed with Alabama. However, he lasted just one season in Tuscaloosa before transferring to Blinn College (about an hour from his hometown) for the 2016 season. After one year at the JUCO level (31 tackles, two interceptions), he went through the recruitment process again, this time signing with Ohio State. After two seasons in Columbus, Sheffield elected to skip his final season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Elite size/speed athlete…track background and easily carries speed down the field…make-up acceleration to recover…fluid hips and doesn’t labor redirecting his momentum…explosive drive quickness…length to influence the catch point…comfortable in face-up in press, staying balanced vs. physical receivers…reliable in 1-on-1 tackle opportunities…calms his feet, stays square and finishes tackles with strong hands…didn’t return kicks or punts at Ohio State, but has return experience at the JUCO and high school levels…solid production the last two years (19 passes defended).","Undeveloped transition technique and footwork…too easily turned around at the stem…excess spacing in man coverage was a consistent issue on tape…struggles to bracket and properly use his hands downfield…inconsistent awareness, especially with his back to the ball…immature tracking and ball skills and wasn’t a playmaker in college…tends to play soft-tempered…inexperienced inside vs. the slot.","A one-year starter at Ohio State, Sheffield lined up as a field cornerback in the Buckeyes’ man-heavy scheme and was one of only two OSU defenders who started all 14 games in 2018. He finished second on the team in passes defended in 2017 (behind Denzel Ward) and tied for the team-lead in 2018. Despite his production, Sheffield wasn’t a playmaker in college, and had questionable instincts, especially downfield with his back to the line of scrimmage. He requires technique work, especially with his lower body, but the athleticism is outstanding and will extend his leash with an NFL coaching staff. Overall, Sheffield can be a frustrating study because he has elite athletic traits for his size, but an inconsistent feel for the position, projecting as a developmental bump-and-run NFL corner.","4th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,35,2,0,1,10,2,31.5,9.25,75.625,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

On the football field, he played wide receiver and defensive back, but his focus was on offense where he broke every school receiving record. Brown posted 68 catches for 968 yards and 14 touchdowns as a senior and finished his career with 159 catches for 2,277 yards and 26 scores, adding three touchdowns on punt returns. He didn’t receive much attention as a recruit, but South Dakota State defensive coaches saw potential and lured him to Brookings as a cornerback. Despite practicing as both a wide receiver and cornerback in 2014, Brown decided to stay on defense (coaches let him choose) where he became a starter as a sophomore. His younger brother (Jacob) is a wide receiver at South Dakota State. Brown accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Controlled feet in his pedal…balanced, well-timed transition to redirect and mirror…well-timed hip turn and looks natural in reverse…high school wide receiver background shows with his ball skills and body position…gets physical at the line of scrimmage and the top of routes…named a senior captain and his coaches speak highly of his matured confidence…durable and started every game the last three seasons.","Doesn’t play as strong as he looks…spends too much time stuck to blocks on the perimeter…average long-speed…late to drive, giving up too much in front of him…guilty of leaning into receivers, losing leverage…overly physical downfield and prone to grabbing…bad habit of going through receivers and needs to play with better timing in his attack…only one career start vs. an FBS opponent (TCU 2016) with almost all of his experience coming vs. FCS competition.                                                                                       [185]","A three-year starter at South Dakota State, Brown played primarily press and off-man for the Jackrabbits, lining up outside with little experience inside the numbers. He had dreams of playing wide receiver at a high level, but was humbled by the recruiting process and made the most of his opportunity, adapting on defense and honing the new position. Brown is more smooth than sudden, but competes with a scrappy mentality and short memory. While he flashes physicality, his aggressive nature comes and goes, most notably in the run game. Overall, Brown lacks elite vertical speed, but his balanced feet and efficient transition allow him to stay on top of routes, projecting as a solid mid-round option.","4th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,29,1,0,1,15,3,30.5,9.625,73.375,4.51,2.65,1.64,39.5,128,.,.,13

He excelled in track (despite it being his least favorite sport) and won the 2014 state title in the long jump (23’6) and 4x100 (41.32) – also ran a personal-best 10.91 in the 100-meters. Johnson was a basketball-first athlete until high school where he split his playing time between quarterback, running back, wide receiver, pass rusher, linebacker and defensive back. He caught 40 passes for 772 yards and 14 touchdowns at West Side, adding two interceptions on defense. Johnson was recruited as a wide receiver and safety and was considered the No. 7 recruit in the state of Indiana. He initially committed to Ohio State, but academics prevented him from becoming a Buckeye and he was forced to go the JUCO route. Johnson was homesick after one season at San Bernardino Valley College and transferred to Garden City Community College in Kansas. He committed to Iowa State for the 2016 season, but academics again prevented him from enrolling at an FBS-level school. Johnson stayed at the JUCO in 2016, but redshirted and focused on the classroom. He was the No. 75 overall JUCO recruit in the 2017 cycle and committed to Kentucky over Georgia. Johnson’s uncle (Jason), who coached him at West Side, was a wide receiver at Illinois State and played three seasons in the NFL. Johnson’s cousin (Jon’Vea) played wide receiver at Toledo and is a prospect in the 2019 NFL Draft. Johnson accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Passes the eye test with a tall, well-built frame…long-limbed (two blocked kicks at Kentucky)…strong-strider to smoothly accelerate and stay on top of routes…transitions well out of his pedal and controls his throttle for a big man…improved patience in press…physical tackler when he squares and locates the ballcarrier’s hip…known as an intense competitor by his teammates…battled for three years at the JUCO level, earning his degree at Kentucky (December 2018).","Upright movements and easily allows space to route-runners…below-average route recognition and constantly plays from behind…slow processor to sort out or anticipate what he sees…poor angle and timing at the catch point…handsy downfield…not a playmaker when the ball is in the air…poor ball production in college with 10 passes defended and one interception in 18 starts…mistakes earlier in games appeared to haunt him, losing his composure…inconsistent run defender due to technique and effort issues.","A two-year starter at Kentucky, Johnson spent three years at the JUCO level due to academics before arriving at Kentucky where he started the last 18 games for the Wildcats. He lined up at left cornerback, mostly outside, but also saw reps inside over the slot receiver. Johnson moves extremely well for his size, but his technique and football IQ aren’t on the same level, playing on natural instinct over know-how. Spacing and body position are both problems on his tape, including timing issues at the catch point, arriving too early (flags) or too late (completed catch and YAC). Overall, Johnson looks straight out of central casting with his rare combination of physical traits, which will likely get him overdrafted as early as the top-50 picks. However, he too often looks lost in coverage due to immature awareness and ball skills, projecting as a developmental press-man corner with a long road ahead of him.","4th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,23,0,0,1,5,1,32.625,9.125,77.5,4.52,2.64,1.55,38,129,4.1,7.01,15

He was part of the school’s state champion 4x400-meter relay team and finished second in the 400-meters (48.97). Ballentine was underrecruited and signed with Division-II Washburn, almost quitting in his first year as a redshirt. He worked his way into the starting rotation as a sophomore safety before moving to cornerback for his final two seasons. Ballentine also ran track at Washburn and owns eight of the 10 fastest times in the 100- meter dash and the six fastest times in the 200-meter dash. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Top-tier athlete…quick-footed with bump-and-run duties…flashes short-area burst and natural body control out of his pedal to stay in phase…stays coordinated in his change of direction…shrewdly uses his length downfield to cut off routes…crowds catch points and is always ball searching…his chippy play demeanor shows in run support…averaged 24.8 yards as a kickoff returner (47/1,166/0)…responsible for four blocked kicks, including three in 2018…coachable attitude and he works hard at his craft, learning things quickly…experienced outside and vs. the slot.","His lack of inches will show at times vs. bigger pass-catchers…can be late to find the football downfield…falls for eye candy and needs to sharpen his vision…inconsistent press-man technique and quick to grab if caught out of position…late to drive from off-coverage…average play strength for the position and needs to clean up his tackling technique…inexperienced vs. top competition.","A three-year starter at Washburn, Ballentine played safety as a sophomore before starting at right cornerback the past two seasons, often shadowing the opponent’s top receiver. He became the first player in school history to win the 2018 Cliff Harris Award as the top defensive player at a small school (Division II or lower). A sprinter on Washburn’s track team, Ballentine plays with the suddenness to stay in the pocket of receivers on tape and he didn’t look out of place vs. better competition during Senior Bowl week. He isn’t shy getting physical and his experience on special teams should help him earn a roster spot. Overall, Ballentine needs to tidy up the technical aspects of the position, but he has the athleticism to survive on an island with the coachable make-up that will set him apart during camp, projecting best in the slot.","4th-5th",.,11,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,50,3,0,2,7,3,31.625,9.5,77,4.47,2.62,1.57,39.5,135,4.14,6.82,15

He moved to cornerback as a freshman at Boca Ciega High School and played both ways his first two prep seasons. After a brief transfer to Lakewood High School, Smith transferred to IMG Academy for his junior and senior seasons, focusing primarily at corner. Over his two seasons there, he combined for 110 tackles, five interceptions and 10 touchdowns (six on defense, four on special teams). Considered a top-10 recruit in the state of Florida and one of the best corners in the nation, Smith whittled his college choice to Florida, Florida State and LSU, choosing the Tigers for their history producing NFL-level defensive backs. He enrolled in January 2016 at LSU, but was buried on the depth chart (behind Tre’Davious White, Donte Jackson, Kevin Toliver and others) and he elected to transfer following spring practice after his freshman season. After one season at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, Smith, who was considered the No. 1 JUCO cornerback in the country, committed to Alabama over South Carolina. He decided to leave Tuscaloosa after one season, entering the 2019 NFL Draft.","Above-average height for the position…light-footed athlete with smooth redirection skills…quickness to mirror and stay on top of routes when he stays disciplined…uses field leverage to his advantage in coverage…plays the ball well once he locates — led Alabama with three interceptions in 2018 (two came against Missouri’s Drew Lock)…playmaker with the ball in his hands, averaging 23.7 yards per interception return with one score (3/71/1)…looks to stab in press…quick to key the run and rally to the football…competes with an edge and uses a sharp punch to keep blockers off him…stays loose in space to break down and chop down ballcarriers.","Good-enough speed for the position, but doesn’t have secondary wheels to recover once beat (see first play on 2018 Ole Miss tape)…undisciplined footwork and technique at the snap, often playing from behind…slight hitch in his transition, creating balance issues…underdeveloped pattern recognition…quick to open his hips in retreat…tends to grab the jersey when he hits the brakes instead of gearing down…late to get his head turned to find the football…attended six different schools over the last six years, which will be interpreted differently by each club.","A one-year starter at Alabama, Smith started the first three games of 2018 before he was benched (in favor of true freshman Patrick Surtain) after giving up a 75-yard touchdown to D.K. Metcalf on the first play of the Ole Miss game. However, he returned to the starting lineup when Trevon Diggs was injured and saw snaps at both left and right cornerback, playing mostly press-man. It wasn’t a surprise to learn that Smith played a lot of quarterback growing up because he is more of an athlete right now than a technically-sound cornerback. His lack of transition burst will lead to spacing issues, but he is a physical player who is equipped to jam and likes mixing it up with receivers. Overall, Smith has the size, quickness and competitive mentality required to play the position in the NFL, but he isn’t a burst player and must refine his technique to better prevent chunk plays for the offense.","4th-5th",.,15,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,60,0.5,0,1,8,3,33.25,9.5,78.875,.,.,.,33,121,4.37,7.09,11

Hollman wasn’t on the recruiting radar with zero offers after graduation. He joined the working force, but emailed dozens of programs with his highlight tape and Toledo was the only program to respond, offering him a walk-on opportunity and joining the team the final week of fall camp. Hollman redshirted in 2014 and became a starter in 2016, receiving a scholarship after his sophomore season. He accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Above-average athleticism…agile-footed and smooth-hipped in his pedal and transition…displays the body control and natural equilibrium to stay on top of routes…quick to turn, locate and choke passing lanes, winning 50-50 match-ups…plays chippy and not shy to challenge routes…shows the requisite mental and physical toughness required…graduated with a degree in communications (May 2018)…experienced on special teams…pushed himself from (non-preferred) walk-on to scout team to three-year starter.","Only average length and bulk on his frame…play strength is a question mark…tardy disposing of blockers and needs to use his hands better…willing, but streaky as a tackler…comes unglued when breaking down as a tackler, struggling to make off-balanced stops…judges the ball well, but leaves production on the field and tends to be inconsistent adjusting and making plays…guilty of biting on initial route movements and playing catch-up the rest of the play.","A three-year starter at Toledo, Hollman was the starting field cornerback in the Rockets’ 4-3 base scheme.

Projecting similar to E.J. Gaines, Hollman managed only two interceptions over 35 starts, but his 13 passes defended in 2018 tied for the conference lead. Play speed is critical at the position and he checks that box, but needs to improve his discipline in coverage and reliability as a tackler. Overall, Hollman does a better job pattern matching from press rather than off-coverage, showing the athleticism to blanket receivers up-and-down the field, projecting as a high-upside developmental cornerback.","4th-5th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,43,0,0,1,13,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

Not highly ranked as a recruit, Moreland flirted with several FBS-level programs, but they were hesitant to offer a 150-pound athlete. He originally committed to Coastal Carolina before a late change, flipping to James Madison. After a productive true freshman season, he was dismissed from the program (June 2015) after he was charged with petit larceny of less than $200 not from a person, a misdemeanor. Moreland considered transferring to the JUCO level (spent a week at Iowa Western), but decided to stay in school at JMU, attending the football games as a fan. James Madison’s new head coach Mike Houston gave Moreland a “tryout” opportunity during 2016 spring drills and he was considered a walk-on as a part-time starter in 2016. Moreland stayed out of trouble and had a productive final two seasons.

His cousin (Curtis Brown) played cornerback at Gilmer and Texas before he was a third-round pick (No. 95 overall) in the 2011 NFL Draft to the Pittsburgh Steelers. His cousin (Bobby Taylor) played cornerback at Notre Dame and was a second-round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft, playing 10 seasons in the NFL. His younger brother (Demarco) is a rising junior linebacker at Texas. Boyd accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Good-sized athlete to match-up with larger targets…owns NFL speed and agility…drive quickness to arrive with the ball, disrupting screens…skilled at using the sidelines and body position to cut off vertical routes…admirable toughness in 50-50 opportunities, always searching and fighting for the football…highly competitive and doesn’t play intimidated…physical in the run game and leverages plays on the perimeter…well-versed as a gunner on punt coverage…outstanding with 34 passes defended the past two seasons.","Choppy footwork in his pedal and transition…cover technique is stuck at a freshman level…below-average ball skills and judgement, despite the stat sheet saying otherwise…easily manipulated with undisciplined eyes, biting on play action and pumps… double-moves from receivers will leave him in their dust…unrefined pattern recognition, leading to spacing issues…flag magnet due to his grabby hands and hips caught out of position downfield…unreliable open-field tackler.","A three-year starter at Texas, Boyd often followed the opponent’s top target, playing left and right corner for the Longhorns. He was productive downfield with more passes defended than games played over the last three seasons. Boyd checks boxes for his size and speed for the next level, flashing the competitive nature and toughness required for the pro game. However, he is routinely late to read his keys with untrustworthy eyes and below-average ball skills. Overall, Boyd’s stay in the NFL could be short-lived due to his mental lapses and false movements, but if he adds discipline to his game, he has starter-level physical traits.","5th",.,14,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,67,4.5,1,1,17,1,30.75,9,74.375,4.45,2.63,1.6,36.5,127,4.08,6.94,19

As a senior, Denmark finished with 49 catches for 851 yards and 12 touchdowns, adding two kickoff returns for scores and earning Second Team All-State honors. He was the No. 337 wide receiver recruit nationally and received interest from FBS programs like Western Kentucky, but that option went away after a coaching change.

Denmark is an impressive height, weight and speed prospect with elite length and promising ball skills at the position. While he is a tall drink of water, his upright, stiff movements hinder his transition skills, leading to balance issues vs. route technicians. Overall, Denmark lacks ideal cornerback experience and is still developing his feel for coverage, but he is too talented to stash on the practice squad, projecting as a developmental prospect for a team that covets length.","5th-6th",.,14,14,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,55,8,1,1,12,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

One of the top players in North Carolina, Fields was the No. 10 cornerback in the 2015 recruiting class and attracted offers from every program in the southwest part of the country. He initially committed to South Carolina before re-opening his recruitment and choosing Clemson over LSU and Texas. Fields’ father (Mark Sr.) was the No. 13 overall pick in the 1995 NFL Draft out of Washington State, playing 10 seasons (two Pro Bowls) at linebacker for the New Orleans Saints, St. Louis Rams and Carolina Panthers.

He logged only six career starts, but played well when given the opportunity, including at the Senior Bowl. While he has his trouble in off and zone coverages, Fields is at his best in press-man where he can rely on his foot speed, sticking to receivers. However, his suspect awareness, ball skills and route recognition will limit his NFL ceiling.

Thomas received recruiting attention from Penn State and Arkansas, but played the 2013 season at prep school Milford Academy (N.Y.) to improve his grades. He went overlooked in the 2014 recruiting class until Temple entered the picture late in the process, giving him his only scholarship offer. After signing as a wide receiver, Thomas practiced at cornerback due to depth issues and the coaches liked what they saw, making the move permanent prior to the 2016 season.

Thomas has an impressive blend of size/speed for the position, but his transition footwork is a mess. He tackles like a former wide receiver and spends more time on blocks than he does in coverage. Overall, Thomas is a tall, long, speedy lump of clay with the competitive nature in coverage needed for the position, but his technique and mental processing skills aren’t ready for the NFL game, projecting as a developmental press cornerback.","6th",.,13,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,21,0,0,0,8,1,33.75,10,82,4.44,2.57,1.53,39.5,131,.,.,8

On defense, Cheevers posted 36 tackles, 17 passes defended and seven interceptions, returning four for touchdowns and earning Small School Player of the Year honors. He ranked as the No. 404 recruit in the state of Florida and committed to Boston College over Buffalo, Kansas and other mid-level offers. Looking to capitalize on his productive 2018 season, Cheevers elected to skip his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Nimble athlete and movement skills…twitchy trigger-and-drive quickness to arrive with the ball…enough speed to stay on top of routes…quickly regains his balance mid-transition…keeps an eye in the backfield from off-coverage…doesn’t let interception opportunities pass him up, leading the FBS with seven interceptions in 2018…impactful after his picks, averaging 19.8 yards per return (9/178/1).","Slender frame with thin pegs…marginal play strength and clings to blockers…too easily bullied by receivers and knocked off his platform…inconsistent results when attempting to box out and high point…undeveloped route recognition…prone to technique lapses, allowing receivers to set up separation breaks…upright in his pedal and movements…below-average run defender, thinking too much and hesitating…inconsistent strike zone and finishing skills…lacks ideal experience with only 15 collegiate starts.","A one-year starter at Boston College, Cheevers stepped in for the departed Isaac Yiadom and Kamrin Moore and became the full-time starter at right cornerback in 2018, playing press, off-man and zone coverages. He led the FBS in interceptions (seven) as a junior and averaged an interception every 8.8 targets. As a productive option running back in high school, it isn’t a surprise to see Cheevers make plays on the ball with his burst and hands. However, he is a better athlete than polished cornerback right now and needs more experience.

Miller didn’t start on the football team until his senior season, helping to lead Oceanside to a 14-1 record in 2014.

Miller is a controlled athlete who shows the ability to shift between gears mid-route, shadowing receivers and keeping a beat on the football. However, he needs to improve his key-and-diagnose skills in coverage and his lack of physicality makes him a target.

He played cornerback his first three seasons before moving to wide receiver as a senior due to the offense’s need for a playmaker. Brown set a school-record with 80 catches in 2013, adding 1,137 receiving yards and seven scores to earn All-State honors. With only one season of production, he went underrecruited and didn’t receive any FBS or FCS offers. Brown considered Division-II and Division-III offers before Troy extended a preferred walk-on spot as a wideout. He played primarily on special teams in 2014 and redshirted in 2015. Brown was moved back to cornerback prior to the 2016 season and quickly earned a starting role on defense. He is related to Hall-of-Fame running back Herschel Walker; his father (Keith) played cornerback at Army; his younger brother (Brittain) is a running back at Duke. Brown accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Built well for the position with long arms…cerebral approach to the position, understanding spacing and route combinations…pattern matches well from zone…doesn’t play hesitant…natural feel for reading breaks and restricting passing lanes…takes advantage of interception opportunities with terrific ball skills (12 career interceptions)…averaged 15.1 yards per interception return with one score (12/181/1)…physical, strong tackler…played well against top competition, including a key forced fumble and interception in the upset win at LSU in September 2017…former walk-on and earned a scholarship prior to the 2017 season.","Below-average long speed for the position with very little recovery ability…lacks twitch in his transition with only average burst…plays overconfident and isn’t shy gambling in coverage…too willing to bite on route fakes, drawing him out of phase…needs to do a better job avoiding and shedding perimeter blocks…the health of his left knee is important after suffering a torn ACL (November 2017), which clearly affected him as a senior.","A two-year starter at Troy, Brown was the boundary cornerback in the Trojans’ scheme and totaled 11 interceptions his sophomore and junior seasons. He was planning to leave school early and enter the 2018 NFL Draft before suffering a torn ACL on an interception in the 2017 regular season finale. His senior year wasn’t up to his standards, but he wasn’t fully healthy as he worked back from the knee injury. Brown plays balanced and creates opportunities for himself in coverage, but his game lacks suddenness and a false step is a death sentence. Overall, Brown processes things quickly and has natural ball skills as a former wideout, but concerns about his athleticism are legitimate, projecting as a developmental zone corner.","7th",.,13,7,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,44,1.5,0,0,7,1,32,9.75,76.375,4.75,2.75,1.68,.,126,4.22,7.33,14

As a senior, he posted 66 tackles and six interceptions (three returned for touchdowns) to earn First Team All-State honors, adding 33 catches for 730 yards and 12 touchdowns as a receiver. Baity was rated as the No. 93 recruit nationally, ultimately choosing Kentucky over nearby South Florida and UCF. Two of his cousins (quarterback Shane Boyd and receiver Aaron Boyd) previously played for the Wildcats. He has a son (Derrick III) and a daughter (Trinity). Baity accepted his invitation to the 2019 East-West Shrine Game.","Excellent size for the position…fluid movements with light feet…strong ball skills and skillfully uses his length to disrupt the catch point…soft hands to finish interceptions…displays a knack for reading the eyes of the receiver and playing through his hands with his back to the ball…trusts his reads and not shy jumping routes…not easily intimidated and enjoys mixing it up with receivers…durable resume in the SEC with consistent ball production over 41 starts.","Below-average speed for the position…upright and flat-footed in his stance with undeveloped transition technique…labors vs. sophisticated routes, struggling to sink-and-mirror…loses balance too easily…freelances often with a questionable mental process…average long-speed and doesn’t close the gap in chase mode…high center of gravity and strike zone as a tackler, lacking the strength to finish and allowing ballcarriers to gain extra yards.","A four-year starter at Kentucky, Baity worked his way into the starting mix as a true freshman and has been a key piece of Kentucky’s defensive success the last four seasons (29 team wins, second-best of any senior class in school history). Despite his resume, he was the lone member of the Wildcats’ secondary not invited to the 2019 Senior Bowl, turning in mixed results at the Shrine Game. Baity tends to play upright and narrow, which technical route-runners will expose, but he has the foot quickness and confidence to quickly drive on throws. Although he doesn’t play meek in coverage, he is an untrustworthy tackler and needs to dial up                                                                                           [196]  the physicality in order to match up at the next level.

As a senior, he collected five interceptions and also had three return touchdowns (two kickoffs, one punt) on special teams. Fenton was the No. 86 cornerback in the 2015 recruiting class and the No. 122 player in the state of Florida, committing to South Carolina over Florida and Louisville.

He had a roller coaster career in Columbia with several splash plays, but also plenty of negative reps. Fenton did his best work in press where he could allow his foot quickness and loose lower body shadow routes, however, his guessing downfield often drew flags. In the run game, he doesn’t play afraid, but he does need to work on his technique in order to be more reliable. Overall, Fenton is a composed athlete with the redirection quickness to stick with any type of receiver, but his grabby hands and questionable mental process are potential road blocks to his pro future.","PFA",.,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,34,2.5,0,0,9,3,30.375,8.75,74,4.52,2.65,1.59,34,117,4.25,.,12

Duck was the No. 360 cornerback in the 2016 recruiting class and the No. 121 player in the state of North Carolina. He received two FBS-level scholarship offers, committing to in-state Appalachian State over Toledo. Duck chose to skip his final season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Quick-footed and stays balanced in his pedal and transition…adequate speed to carry vertical routes…highly competitive at the catch point…judges the ball well in flight to gain body position and time his attack…natural feel for spacing and pattern recognition…opportunistic player, reading the eyes of the quarterback and staying aggressive…puts his hat on the belt of the ballcarrier as a tackler…posted 12 interceptions, including one returned for a score (12/150/1)…averaged 10.5 yards per punt return (31/324/1), including a touchdown in 2018.","Poor testing numbers…undersized, lacking ideal height and build…play strength concerns pop up regularly on tape, both vs. the run and in coverage…ballcarriers are able to run through his tackle attempts…not going to disengage blocks once locked up…overpowered at the top of routes…will get his hips turned and late to recover and his first response is to grab, attracting flags…little jam experience.","A three-year starter at Appalachian State, Duck was the boundary cornerback in the Mountaineers’ 3-4 base scheme, starting all 39 games over the last three seasons. His 12 career interceptions are the second-most in the FBS over the last three years, one behind Virginia’s Juan Thornhill (13). Duck is a light-footed athlete with man-coverage skills, using his aggressive nature and intelligence to make plays. It is easy to appreciate his competitive make-up, but he often looks like a kid trying to tackle his older brother as a run defender, which usually doesn’t end well for him. Overall, Duck owns the athleticism, awareness and scrappy toughness to survive at the next level, but his marginal size and strength will be tough to overcome, projecting best in the nickel.","PFA",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,51,3,0,0,6,1,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He transitioned to defense prior to the 2017 season and was a graduate transfer to Nevada for his final season of eligibility in 2018, finishing second on the team in passes defended (eight) and interceptions (two). Dotson plays with confidence on an island with terrific pass break angles to the football. He shows hip tightness at the top of patterns and is connecting the dots with route combinations, but he is quick to trigger once he sees it. Despite his size, he is active fighting through blocks and is a strong one-on-one tackler. Overall, Dotson is still green at the position with only two years of corner experience, but he is a physical tackler with promising read/react skills in man.","PFA",.,13,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,75,0,0,2,8,2,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

He started 44 games for the Green Wave, tallying double-digit passes defended each of the last three years (often following the opponent’s top receiver). Lewis loves to compete in press-man, showing nimble feet to mirror-and-match and decent length to challenge receivers. A former receiver in high school, he is quick to locate and plays the ball with timing and savvy to consistently crowd the catch point. While he plays quick, he isn’t explosive and his finishing strength is a concern, often getting muscled off the top of routes.

He was a part-time starter his first three seasons before becoming a full-time starter as a senior, finishing second on the team in passes defended. Davis is a tall drink of water with a physical play style, knocking the ball out when he accurately times his arrival. However, he doesn’t anticipate routes or show fundamental discipline in his coverage, lacking the foot quickness to recover. He is an aggressive run defender, but spotty tackling technique leads to positive plays for the offense.

After playing mostly special teams in 2017, he started 11 games as a senior and led the team in pass break-ups before suffering a fracture in his neck in the season finale (Nov. 2018). A balanced athlete, Nixon makes quick reads to click-and-close on routes, but his ball awareness isn’t as sharp once he turns his back. He is one of the better corner prospects in this class at taking on blocks, shedding and making sure tackles, finishing with an accurate strike zone.

His lowest production came in 2018, but he suffered a torn pec in fall camp, putting off surgery and playing through the injury. Although the lack of size/speed will show in coverage and against the run, Peavy is a persistent competitor and plays tougher than he looks. He does a great job reading routes, using his quick feet and silky hips to locate the football and disrupt the passing lane.

He is a quick-footed athlete capable of carrying speed vertically, but he plays too upright and rigid in his movements, hindering his turn-and-run skills.

He played primarily single-high, but has experience across the secondary and was the only player in the country with 160-plus tackles and 9-plus interceptions over the past two seasons. Adderley has Hall-of-Fame bloodlines as the cousin of Herb Adderley, who is an important role model and they talk “three or four” times a week. Although he lacks an ideal body type for the position, he runs the alley with conviction and finishes in space.

He played quarterback, running back and receiver on offense and pass rusher, linebacker and safety on defense as Sehome combined to win only five games his junior and senior seasons. Rapp posted 117 tackles, 7.0 tackles for loss, four forced fumbles and three interceptions as a senior, earning First Team All-State honors at safety. He was the No. 27 rated safety in the 2016 recruiting class and earned a scholarship offer from Washington (his dream school) after his performance at a junior camp. A Chinese-American, Rapp’s father (Chris) is Canadian and mother (Chiyan) is Chinese (Taylor can speak Chinese and has dual citizenship in the United States and Canada). His older brother (Austin) played quarterback at Sehome before walking on as a linebacker at Washington State. Rapp elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Highly intelligent and quick to diagnose…understands football geometry and doesn’t misjudge angles…short-area quickness to cleanly redirect his momentum…excellent closing burst vs. the run…controlled tackler, squaring his target, staying low and finishing with strong hands…accurate strike zone to create stopping power at contact…fearless and willingly sticks his nose in the fire…maneuvers through congestion without creating a 12-car pile-up…active blitzer…physical to the ball in coverage…extra effort and toughing out injuries are standard for him…double-digit starts each of his three seasons in college.","Below-average timed speed…not twitchy and lacks elite range or make-up speed…needs to improve his pedal and transition technique…more of a battering ram downhill and needs to better use his hands to work off contact…suffered a hip injury in the Pac-12 Championship Game (December 2018) and had to sit out the Rose Bowl against Ohio State…suffered a hairline fracture in his left hand (March 2016).","A three-year starter at Washington, Rapp was a versatile chess piece in the middle of the field for the Huskies, lining up at linebacker, nickel and both safety spots throughout his career. When drafted, he will be the second (and likely the highest) Chinese-American selected in the NFL Draft (OL Ed Wang was a fifth- rounder in the 2010 NFL Draft and played four seasons in the NFL). Rapp is one of the “smartest guys I’ve ever coached,” according to Huskies defensive coordinator Jimmy Lake and his instincts and intelligence are the first traits that stand out on film. He is always in chase mode (doesn’t know how to turn it off) and won’t make mental mistakes. Overall, Rapp’s subpar 40-yard dash sticks out like a sore thumb, but his smarts, toughness vs. the run and ability to handle coverage responsibilities make him a high floor prospect, projecting as a decade-long NFL starting safety.","1st-2nd",30,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,59,6,5,0,7,2,30.75,9,72.875,.,.,.,35,115,3.99,6.82,17

He started at both quarterback and safety, earning conference Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior. Abram was considered a top-15 recruit in the state of Mississippi and committed to Georgia over Ole Miss and Louisville. He earned immediate starting reps for the Bulldogs and finished his freshman year with 25 tackles, but left the program following the dismissals of Mark Richt and Jeremy Pruitt. Abram played at Jones County Junior College in 2016 and was considered the top JUCO safety recruit, committing to Mississippi State for his final two collegiate seasons over Alabama, LSU and others. Abram married his wife (Bri’Anna) in May 2018 and they have a one-year old daughter (Harlee). He accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl, but was unable to participate due to a shoulder injury.","Good-looking athlete and fills out his uniform well…doesn’t lack for play speed or physicality and looks like a missile making cross-field stops…plays with a touch of insanity and closes with thump…adequate field vision and reaction skills to identify things quickly…clean pedal and change of direction when asked to play man coverage…flies down the field with violent intentions on special teams coverages…powers through blocks as a blitzer…considered one of the team leaders on the field and behind the scenes…graduated with his degree in business and marketing (December 2018).","Overaggressive pursuit leads to off-balance and missed tackle attempts in space…inconsistent strike zone, corralling high or chopping low…bad habit of leading with his helmet, going for the blow up hit instead of the sure tackle…inconsistent hand use near the line of scrimmage and can be taken out of plays…has the athleticism for man-coverage, but gets grabby and shows marginal instincts, especially with his back to the ball…doesn’t have a feel for spacing and the quarterback will attack him when left alone in single coverage…physical play leads to durability concerns – shoulder injury was flagged during Senior Bowl medicals.","A two-year starter at Mississippi State, Abram played field safety for the Bulldogs and was an enforcer on both defense and special teams coverages. He runs the alley like a speeding bullet, but doesn’t consistently come to balance and his aggressive play style is his best and most worrisome quality. Although he reacts well and plays with boundless energy, Abram struggles to anticipate and is at his best where he can run-and-hit. Overall, Abram is not the type of safety who will sniff out routes and thrive in deep coverage, but he is a tempo-setter with the fast and physical appetite to hunt, projecting at-best as a starting NFL strong safety and at-worst a special teams standout.","2nd",41,13,11,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,99,9,3,1,7,2,31.375,9.625,73.625,4.44,2.6,1.56,33.5,116,.,.,16

He competed in the long-jump and triple-jump and set the school-records in the 100-meters (10.38) and 200-meters (21.02). On the football field, Gardner-Johnson played in every varsity game over his four seasons, lining up as a do-everything defensive back who also contributed a bit on offense. He finished his senior year with 55 tackles, two interceptions and 927 all-purpose yards. Gardner-Johnson ranked as the No. 4 cornerback and the No. 42 player overall in the 2016 recruiting class, committing to Florida over Alabama, Georgia and Notre Dame. He added “Johnson” to his last name during the 2017 season to honor his stepfather (Brian Johnson), who raised Gardner-Johnson since he was a toddler. His biological father (Chauncey Gardner Sr.) is still in his life. Gardner-Johnson elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Terrific athleticism and chase speed…looks like he was shot out of a cannon when closing…excellent pre-snap recognition…sniffs out screens to beat blockers to the spot…takes aggressive routes in coverage…when he had a chance at the interception, he took advantage with nine picks in college…playmaker with the ball in his hands, averaging 33.4 yards per interception return with three touchdowns…experienced blitzer with speed to chase from the backside…toughness to set the edge near the line of scrimmage…well-versed on special teams, finishing second on the team in special teams tackles in 2018…doesn’t lack for confidence and developed more of a leadership voice as a junior…experienced at safety, nickel and outside cornerback.","Shorter than ideal with average bulk for the position…unbalanced transition skills and struggles vs. route technicians…undisciplined eyes and falls for eye candy…inconsistent man-to-man technique…average-at-best play strength and spends too much time hung up on perimeter blocks…struggles to calm his feet, square up the ballcarrier and finish when in motion…often needs help to finish tackles to the ground…rubbed some the wrong way over his tenure at Florida (he is “self-absorbed,” according to several former teammates).","A three-year starter at Florida, Gardner-Johnson arrived in Gainesville as a highly-touted cornerback, but moved to safety during his true freshman season, becoming a full-time starter in 2017 when Marcell Harris suffered a season-ending injury. Gardner-Johnson moved to the “STAR” position in Todd Grantham’s five-man secondary in 2018, playing primarily a nickel role where he looked much more comfortable than in a traditional safety spot. He was one of the leaders on the Florida defense, actively getting his teammates lined up and communicating play calls. He has proven flexibility in the secondary, both athletically and mentally, to play multiple spots. Overall, Gardner-Johnson needs to dial back his aggressive nature to be a more consistent finisher, but he is a play-disruptor with the way he reads and flies around the field, projecting as an ideal nickel in today’s NFL.","2nd",48,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,71,9,3,0,6,4,30.875,9.25,74,4.48,2.62,1.58,36,117,4.2,7.03,17

He played quarterback on offense and posted 1,299 passing yards and 1,562 rushing yards as a senior, adding five interceptions as a safety on defense. On the basketball court, Thornhill recorded over 1,000 career points and made SportsCenter with his high-flying dunks. He received scholarship offers to play collegiate basketball, but he chose football. Ranked as an “athlete” recruit, he was the No. 22 player in the state and committed to Virginia (his first offer) as a safety prior to his junior season, subsequently shutting down his recruitment. He played both cornerback and safety over his collegiate career. Thornhill accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl.","Long, rangy size…smooth shuffle and clean redirection in space…comfortable in man-to-man, using physicality and contact balance to attach and ride patterns…recognizes route concepts and has the diagnosis abilities of a former quarterback…flashes the reaction quickness to drive and undercut routes…above- average tracking, judgement and ball skills (his 13 career interceptions rank sixth-best in school history)…averaged 13.6 yards per interception return (13/177/0)…doesn’t lack for toughness as a tackler and takes proper pursuit angles…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (December 2018)…versatile experience with 36 starts spread between cornerback (22) and safety (14).","Lanky and lacks a prototypical build for an NFL safety…lacks twitchy turn-and-run skills…not a burner…inconsistent take-on skills downhill…doesn’t back down as a tackler, but arrives hot and needs to improve his strike zone…overly patient with his reads and would like to see him take more chances…grabby downfield, attracting holding calls.","A three-year starter at Virginia, Thornhill arrived in Charlottesville as a safety before moving outside to corner his sophomore and junior seasons. He moved to the “Sabre” strong safety position as a senior and led the team in tackles (98) and interceptions (6), playing everywhere from nickel to single-high to linebacker (showed he can just as easily press as he can play from deep positioning). Thornhill, who wears No. 21 for Sean Taylor, doesn’t play as fast as he timed, but he has a smooth lower body and doesn’t get off-balance in his movements. He has plus anticipation and ball skills, but will take the worst of hits when his tackling technique isn’t perfect. Overall, Thornhill is more smooth than sudden, which causes him to be a beat late at times, but his instincts, field range and roster versatility are strong selling points, projecting as a high alignment safety who can walk down and cover slot receivers.","2nd",49,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,98,4.5,0,0,13,6,31.125,8.75,74.75,4.42,2.6,1.57,44,141,.,.,21

As a senior, Thompson helped lead West Orange-Stark to the Class 4A Division-II state title game and finished 2014 with 37 catches for 692 yards and four touchdowns on offense and five interceptions on defense. He was ranked as the No. 2 safety in the 2015 recruiting class, behind only Derwin James. Thompson received an offer from Alabama as a sophomore and immediately committed, staying true to that pledge despite several other offers from schools like LSU, Oklahoma and Texas. He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Tall, long frame…rangy and covers a lot of real estate…excellent drive quickness, closing on routes…clean footwork and hip action in his pedal…makes athletic adjustments on the football…natural ball skills and timing…reads the quarterback and trusts what he sees…aggressive hands to get physical at the top of routes or fight off blocks…physical in run defense, looking to wrap-and-drive…fearless running the alley and plants ballcarriers in the hole…studious player—coaches have to kick him out of the film room…graduated with a degree in environmental science (August 2018).","Lean-limbed and lacks ideal body armor…inconsistent eye discipline and can be caught out of position…guilty of false steps…late to diagnose route combinations at the snap…inconsistent habits as a run defender leads to missed tackles…struggles to calm his feet and come to balance on the move…limited experience as a blitzer…character isn’t considered an issue, but he was arrested (April 2017) and indicted on one count of felony aggravated assault for his role in a spring break fight, but the charges were later dropped (February 2019)…suffered a torn wrist ligament and required surgery (February 2019), sidelining him for the NFL combine.","A one-year starter at Alabama, Thompson was the only returning defensive back in 2018 with any starting experience (made two starts in the 2017 College Football Playoff when Hootie Jones suffered a knee injury) and started all 15 games at free safety, lining up single-high and covering the slot receiver in man coverage. He understands route timing and shows an instinctive feel for what the offense is trying to do. Against the run, Thompson’s tackling doesn’t always look textbook, but he usually gets his man on the ground. While he has the physical mentality to be a reliable run defender, his lack of bulk leads to durability concerns.

He also lettered in basketball as the starting point guard, averaging 16.8 points per game. Hooker was the No. 35 safety recruit in the 2016 class and received only one power-five offer (Iowa) despite several attempts to stay close to home at Minnesota.

Hooker is quick to read run/pass and puts himself in position to make plays with his ability to sense what is about to happen. That anticipation helps mask his lack of athletic twitch, but his lack of ideal range will be amplified vs. NFL-level skill weapons.

He was admittedly immature and “lost his love” for the game early in his CU career, which contributed to his 2016 suspension, but the time away (and the birth of his son) appeared to reenergize his passion for football. Worthington offers an exciting combination of size, length and athleticism, displaying the skill-set to handle slot duties or match up with tight ends. He has a healthy appetite as a tackler, but needs to improve his consistency as a finisher, especially if he hopes to carve out a role on special teams. Overall, Worthington doesn’t have the tape of a playmaker, but he has intriguing traits to fill different roles, projecting best near the line of scrimmage with his size and instincts.","4th-5th",.,9,9,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,48,2,1,0,7,1,32.75,9.5,76.875,4.63,2.73,1.65,33.5,121,4.37,7.07,17

As a senior, Harris posted 77 tackles, 20 pass break-ups and three interceptions and recorded 10 touchdown catches on offense, earning the 2014 NEPSAC Player of the Year honors. He was the No. 8 recruit in the state of Connecticut and committed to Boston College over Connecticut, Old Dominion and Syracuse. His father (William Sr.) was a wide receiver and captain at Mississippi State (1989-92) and was drafted in the seventh round (No. 195 overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills.

However, he plays too reactionary, which severely limits his playmaking potential at the next level.

Blair finished strong as a senior, earning Division-II All-State honors. He also ran track with a personal-best 11.13 in the 100-meters, also placing 10th in the long jump (21’ 5.5) in the 2015 state championship. Considered a top-30 recruit in the state of Ohio in the 2015 recruiting class, Blair committed to Syracuse over Kent State, Purdue and Toledo. However, grades were an issue. Blair took extra classes to qualify, but the NCAA informed him in August that he failed to do so, rejecting an online math course. He was forced to regroup and landed at Dodge City Community College where he spent two seasons, earning First Team NJCAA All-American honors in 2016 with 99 tackles and 24.0 tackles for loss.

Blair looks like the 195- pound version of Kam Chancellor on tape, running the alley with conviction and creating violent collisions. While his tenacious mentality is a plus, he needs to harness his all-or-nothing style to play smarter and eliminate mistakes. Overall, Blair has several translatable traits, notably his play range and highly aggressive mindset, but his wiry body type and undisciplined tendencies vs. both the pass and the run are concerns, projecting as a tweener NFL safety with his best football ahead of him.","4th-5th",.,14,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,59,2,0,1,4,2,30.75,8.25,74.75,4.48,2.63,1.55,35,125,.,.,.

He played single-high, but mostly lined up over the slot receiver in man coverage, also playing on special teams as a returner and cover man. Amadi trusts his eyes and instincts to put himself in position to make plays, taking accurate angles and arriving on time. His lack of size and twitch often show in man coverage, allowing receivers to uncover or make plays before he can react.

With his press-man background, Hampton has the traits of a ballhawk, using his athleticism and tracking skills to make plays on the ball. However, his average anticipation and suddenness will make it tougher for him to be a playmaker with the action sped up at the next level.

On the football field, Willis was a three-year starting running back and finished his prep career with 4,432 rushing yards. He was named a finalist for the Michigan Player of the Year after rushing for 2,800 yards (11.6 average) and 31 touchdowns as a senior, including nine 200-yard rushing games.

Willis displays a keen understanding of situations and offensive tendencies, trusting his eyes and putting himself in the neighborhood. He shows quality run fits downhill, but labors when redirecting and doesn’t show the speed desired for whole-field work.

A long-time team leader, Wingard is a ball magnet with a high batting average as a tackler, understanding how to get his man on the ground. With average size and length, his strength doesn’t always match his intentions and his comfort level isn’t the same when asked to play in reverse. Overall, Wingard has some limitations in man coverage, but he understands angles with an outstanding feel for what the offense is doing before it happens, projecting as an NFL backup and core special teamer (similar to Cincinnati Bengals safety Clayton Fejedelem).","6th-7th",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,87,2.5,1,0,3,2,30.5,8.625,74,4.56,2.65,1.57,36.5,121,4.2,7.08,9

Peters also starred on the basketball team, averaging 18.2 points and 8.0 rebounds in 2014. He was the No. 3 rated safety in the 2015 recruiting class (behind Derwin James and Deionte Thompson) and was widely considered the top player in the state. Peters considered offers from Alabama, LSU and others, ultimately choosing Mississippi State over Ole Miss.

In 46 career games, he fell just shy of 100 tackles and managed only 13 passes defended and three interceptions. At 218 pounds, Peters is the only 215-plus prospect among my top-50 safeties in this class and his size/length stand out on tape. However, he isn’t a quick-twitch or burst player with suspect reaction quickness, allowing receivers to create space.

West missed almost all of his senior season after suffering a broken leg the summer prior to the 2013 season (and rebreaking it a few months later). Despite the injuries, West was the No. 17 safety in the 2014 recruiting class and committed to Kentucky over Notre Dame, Penn State and Wisconsin. He has two sons, Keon and Keelan.

He played a versatile safety role and lined up low and high, often dropping into the box where he was used as a hybrid linebacker. West is an assignment sound run defender, squaring up his target and finishing with a thump. His athleticism isn’t an issue, but his inconsistent trigger and lateral range limit his ceiling as a cover defender. Overall, West’s injury history (breaking his right leg three times in a 14-month span) is a bright red flag, but his highly aggressive nature and play speed translate well to the NFL level, making him worth a pick in the later rounds.","7th",.,13,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,86,1,0,0,9,3,31.375,9.125,75.75,4.39,2.61,1.52,33.5,113,.,.,19

Randall was the No. 29 recruit in the state of Pennsylvania and signed with Temple over several MAC programs, but he first attended East Coast Prep for a postgraduate year in 2014, collecting 10 touchdown catches. His original letter of intent with Temple was still binding and he joined the program in May 2015 as a safety.

He earned a coveted single-digit as a junior for his work ethic and impact on the team. Randall flies around and makes highlight-reel hits, but his inconsistent physicality and poor technique lead to missed tackles. While he shows impressive ball skills in coverage, he is often late to read run/pass and is caught guessing. Overall, Randall’s tape is full of splash plays, but his body of work makes it very tough to trust him, especially as a tackler, projecting as a back-end safety on an NFL roster who must earn his keep on special teams.","7th",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,85,2,0,2,10,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

His game film is a roller coaster with several encouraging moments, but he looked undraftable on several of his tapes (2018 Wake Forest). A quicker-than-fast athlete, Denis is a fluid mover and jumps on mistakes by the offense, although he needs to better understand route construction for his game to translate to the NFL. He attacks the football like a former wide receiver, but he also tackles like one too, struggling when coming to balance downhill. Overall, Denis is a cornerback-safety tweener, flashing suddenness and ball skills, but his hot/cold instincts and low batting average as a tackler are red flags, projecting as a potential dime defensive back.","PFA",.,12,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,49,0.5,0.5,1,3,1,31.25,9.5,74.875,4.64,2.71,1.63,33.5,116,4.09,6.89,16

After two seasons on special teams, he started all 26 games over the last two seasons, including his senior year as the team captain. Kinnel is a smaller-framed, compact safety who sees plays developing pre-snap and puts himself in position to work around road blocks, taking the quickest angle to the ball. He trusts his instincts and packs a punch at contact, although he needs to clean up his technique to be a more consistent finisher. Overall, Kinnel isn’t a playmaker in coverage, but his physical nature in the run game and on special teams is his best quality, projecting similarly to current free agent Eddie Pleasant, who carved out a modest NFL career after going undrafted.","PFA",.,13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,74,3,0,0,2,0,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.

It was bust city studying Indiana’s back-seven in 2018 and Crawford, lining up mostly as the field safety, was a part of that, although his one interception was also the first defensive touchdown in his career. While he is a technically sound tackler, he lacks finishing strength, often sliding off ballcarriers. In coverage, he plays too reactive and his average-at-best athletic traits lead to spacing issues, struggling to sniff out and jump routes.

He is an aggressive downhill defender who is always willing to attack blocks with violence and throw himself into the scrum. He is fearless setting the edge and taking on contact, but his lack of length and finishing strength lead to positive plays for the offense. In pass coverage, he displays adequate footwork in reverse and downfield ball skills, but is late to read routes and tends to grab once he loses a step.
