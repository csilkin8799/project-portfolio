He became the starting quarterback there as a sophomore and quickly emerged as one of the top prep passers in the country. After earning Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year honors as a junior, Haskins completed 59.4 percent of his passes (170-of-286) for 2,217 yards and 20 touchdowns, earning consensus First Team All-State honors and finishing his career with 5,308 passing yards and 54 touchdowns. He was the No. 7 ranked pro-style passer in the 2016 recruiting cycle and initially recruited to Maryland during his junior year. However, two things changed: Maryland fired the previous coaching staff, including current head coach Mike Locksley who was his main recruiter; and Ohio State (Haskins’ dream school) made a hard push for him. Former Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer called Haskins the “best” high school quarterback that he had ever seen. He flipped to Ohio State in the weeks before signing day and redshirted in 2016. After backing up J.T. Barrett in 2017, Haskins had a record-setting sophomore season in 2018. He skipped his final two years and entered the 2019 NFL Draft.","Special arm talent…long-levered, but has an efficient load-and-fire release with the ball exploding off his hand…unforced velocity to drive the ball to every inch of the field…throws receivers open with a natural feel for accuracy…large-framed, sturdy passer…sees the entire field and stands tall in the pocket to allow routes to develop…comfortable making high-to-low reads, resetting his eyes on the move…productive on throws 20-plus yards (45.6 percent completions, 14 touchdowns, one interception)…plays poised and confident, showing improved reaction to pressure as the season progressed…at his best in high-pressure situations, completing 71.4 percent of passes with 12.3 yards per attempt, four touchdown passes and zero interceptions in one-score situations in the fourth quarter…not a nimble athlete, but coordinated with his pocket movements…able to fire strikes on the move without sacrificing placement…remarkable production in 2018, becoming only the sixth FBS player to throw for 50 touchdowns in a single-season – his 54 career touchdown passes ranks fourth-best in Ohio State history.","YEAR (GP/GS) CP-ATT          CP%     YDS     TD   INT     CAR    YDS      AVG TD             NOTES 2016: Redshirted 2017: (8/0)     40-57        70.2    565     4    1       24     86       3.6     0 2018: (14/14) 373-533        70.0    4,831   50   8       79     108      1.4     4          Finalist for Heisman Trophy; Big Ten Offensive and Quarterback of the Year Total: (22/14) 413-590       70.0    5,396   54   9       103    194      1.9     4              HT      WT ARM         HAND WING 40-YD 20-YD 10-YD                         VJ            BJ         SS     3C      BP COMBINE     6033 231 33 1/2 09 5/8 79 1/2 5.04                 2.90 1.75               28 1/2        -          -      -       -    (no broad, shuttle or 3-cone – choice) PRO DAY     N/A (stood on Combine numbers; positional drills only)  ",14,14,373,533,70,4831,50,8,79,108,1.3670886075949367,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,33.5,9.625,79.5,5.04,2.9,1.75,28.5,.,.,.,.,2019,2019,"Washington Redskins",1,15,"HaskDw00"

As a three-year starter, he led Allen High School to three straight state titles with a perfect 43-0 record as a starter. As a senior in 2014, Murray was responsible for 6,198 yards (4,713 passing, 1,485 rushing) and 79 touchdowns (54 passing, 25 rushing), finishing his prep career with over 14,500 total yards and 186 combined scores. He collected several honors, including Texas and National Player of the Year Award by several publications. Murray was ranked as the No. 1 dual- threat quarterback recruit in the 2015 cycle and narrowed his college choice to Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Texas A&M, choosing the Aggies. His father (Kevin) was a four-year starting quarterback at Texas A&M and finished his career holding most school passing records (chronic ankle injuries kept him from a professional career). Kyler’s uncle (Calvin) was a first-round pick in the 1989 MLB Draft out of Texas and played five seasons in MLB (1999-2004). Kyler Murray spent only one season at Texas A&M before transferring to Oklahoma, sitting out the 2016 season. After spending the 2017 season as Baker Mayfield’s back-up, he had a prolific junior season, winning the Heisman Trophy. Murray was also a standout prep baseball player and was the first player to ever be selected for both the Under Armour All-America Baseball Game and Football Game. He would have been a top pick in the 2015 MLB Draft, but chose to attend Texas A&M, although he transferred before playing baseball for the Aggies. He played 51 games for the Sooners in 2018 and hit .296 with 10 home runs, 13 doubles, 47 RBIs, 46 runs and 10 stolen bases. Murray was drafted No. 9 overall in the 2018 MLB Draft by the Oakland Athletics and signed a contract, including a $4.66 million signing bonus, with the understanding that he would join the A’s following the Sooners 2018 football season. After his Heisman-winning season, Murray elected to forego his remaining college eligibility and play professional football instead of baseball (Murray: “Moving forward, I am firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an NFL quarterback”).","Boasts a whip of an arm with the velocity to deliver lasers…quick release, using various arm angles…naturally accurate, regardless if throwing with a firm base or off-platform…throws a catchable ball and his passes arrive with touch…on-target deep ball, dropping the ball over coverage and in the bucket…dynamic athlete with instant speed…sudden feet in the pocket to elude rushers…patient behind the line of scrimmage with innate instincts to sense pressure, falling back on his athleticism only when necessary…confident competitor and small window throws don’t intimidate him…incredibly productive 2018 season, leading the nation in total yards (school record 5,362), points responsible (342), yards per completion (16.8) and yards per pass attempt (FBS record 11.6).","YEAR (GP/GS) CP-ATT          CP% YDS           TD     INT      CAR   YDS     AVG TD            NOTES 2015: (8/3)     72-121       59.5 686          5      7        54    335     6.3 1             Texas A&M 2016: Sat out due to transfer rules                                                            Oklahoma 2017: (7/1)     18-21        85.7 359          3      0        14    142     10.1    0         Oklahoma 2018: (14/13) 260-377        69.0 4,361        42     7        140   1,001   7.2     12        Oklahoma; Heisman Trophy; Davey O’Brien Award; First-Team All-American Total: (29/17) 350-519       67.4 5,406        50     14       208   1,478   7.1     13               HT     WT ARM              HAND        WING      40-YD 20-YD 10-YD           VJ           BJ      SS     3C      BP COMBINE      5101 207 28 1/2 09 1/2                 69 1/2    -     -     -               -            -       -      -       -     (no workout – choice) PRO DAY      N/A (positional drills only)  ",14,13,260,377,69,4361,42,7,140,1001,7.15,12,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,28.5,9.5,69.5,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,2019,2019,"Arizona Cardinals",1,1,"MurrKy00"

"JARRETT STIDHAM","QB","Auburn",8,"8/8/1996","22.73","rJR",74.375,218,"Stephenville, Texas","Stephenville",4,"A four-star quarterback recruit out of high school, Jarrett Stidham grew up in Kentucky and was part of a youth football state championship team (49ers) that included former Alabama RB Damien Harris. Along with his mother (Rochelle) and older brother (Juder), he moved to Stephenville, Texas at age 9. He developed a close bond with Matt and Katy Copeland (pillars in the Stephenville community), and once he turned 18 years old, Stidham moved in with the Copelands and their three daughters and considers them his family. At Stephenville, Stidham started at wide receiver as a sophomore and caught 11 touchdowns to earn Honorable Mention All-State honors. He took over as the starting quarterback as a junior and earned district MVP honors with 30 touchdown passes in 2013. As a senior, Stidham was named Second Team All-State despite missing two games with a hand injury, finishing with 50 scores (35 passing, 15 rushing). He also earned All- District honors in basketball and ran track in high school. Stidham originally committed to Texas Tech during his junior year in high school, but nine months later he decommitted and days later announced he was headed to Baylor (Art Briles won four state championships as the head coach at Stephenville). He spent most of the 2015 season as the Bears’ backup before starting three games late in the season when Seth Russell was injured. Briles was fired (May 2016) from Baylor amid scandal, and Stidham elected to transfer. For the 2016 season, he enrolled in online courses at Waco’s McLennan Community College and joined the Midway High School program as a scout team quarterback. Considered the No. 1 ranked JUCO recruit, Stidham hoped to stay in Texas (Texas A&M was his preferred destination), but his second recruitment led him to Auburn. After two seasons with the Tigers, he elected to leave school early for the 2019 NFL Draft and accepted his invitation to the 2019 Senior Bowl. Stidham is engaged to Kennedy Brown, a former Baylor soccer player and the daughter of Houston Rockets CEO Tad Brown.","Well-built frame with room to get stronger…above-average arm strength…able to add RPMs to thread the needle on tight-window throws…his tape is littered with examples of correct placement throws…holds the Auburn record for consecutive pass attempts (162) without an interception…smooth, repeatable throwing mechanics…strong-striding athlete to take the yardage when it is there…outstanding finishing toughness as a runner, lowering his shoulder and driving forward…moves well in the pocket and plays with a sense of control…graduated with his bachelor’s degree (May 2018) and started work on his master’s…named a 2018 team captain, and his leadership skills grew over his time at Auburn.","YEAR (GP/GS) CP-ATT         CP%       YDS     TD   INT      CAR    YDS    AVG TD           NOTES 2015: (10/3)     75-109     68.8      1,265   12   2        36     70     1.9 2            Baylor 2016: Did not play college football 2017: (14/14) 246-370 66.5            3,158   18   6        103    153    1.5    4         Auburn; SEC Newcomer of the Year; Second Team All-SEC 2018: (13/13) 224-369 60.7            2,794   18   5        72     1      0.0    3         Auburn; Team Captain; Bowl Game MVP Total: (37/30) 545-848 64.3           7,217   48   13       211    224    0.9    9              HT      WT ARM         HAND WING 40-YD 20-YD 10-YD                        VJ            BJ       SS     3C     BP COMBINE     6023 218 32            09 1/8 76 1/2 4.81          2.83 1.71              31            09’02”   4.33   7.28   - PRO DAY     N/A (stood on Combine numbers; positional drills only)  ",13,13,224,369,60.7,2794,18,5,72,1,0.013888888888888888,3,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,32,9.125,76.5,4.81,2.83,1.71,31,110,4.33,7.28,.,2019,2019,"New England Patriots",4,133,"StidJa00"

After rushing for nearly 1,300 yards as a sophomore, he rushed for 948 yards and 13 touchdowns in only four games as a junior, missing six games due to a shoulder injury. Jacobs moved from running back to wildcat quarterback as a senior and averaged 15.1 yards per carry in 2015 with 2,704 rushing yards and 31 touchdowns on 179 carries, earning First Team All-State honors. Despite his production, he went underrecruited and didn’t have an FBS offer two months before signing day. However, schools started to take notice in the final weeks, especially when Oklahoma offered the in-state recruit. Alabama offered a week before signing day and Jacobs committed to the Crimson Tide over Missouri. His parents divorced when he was 8 years old and Jacobs moved in with his father (Marty), often sleeping in their car as money was tight (Marty later won custody of Josh and his four siblings). Jacobs has a 3-year old son (Braxton). He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Compact, athletic frame…easy explosion off his plant foot…makes sudden 90-degree cuts without losing speed…changes gaps in a blink at the line of scrimmage with his lateral jump cuts…agile steps in tight spaces…physical finisher and gives as good as he gets when meeting linebackers in the hole…lowers his pads and can be his own blocker…strong lower body, running through ankle tackles…hand-eye coordination and ball skills to make easy adjustments as a pass catcher…was more than just a screen target in college, doing damage on seam and angle routes…only three career fumbles…able to slow down rushers in pass protection…became                                                                                    [13]  the team’s lead blocker in 2018 and bullied defenders…was a key part of multiple special teams coverages with kick return experience, averaging 30.6 yards per return in 2018 with one touchdown (14/428/1)…coaches call him an “intense” practice player and effort is not a concern (Alabama center Ross Pierschbacher: “He does everything right.

He elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Runs with subtle quickness to make defenders miss…makes lateral cuts without slowing…glides away from tacklers and has a natural understanding of run angles…surprises pursuit with his ability to cut back and set up his second and third moves…loves the spin move, staying controlled…outstanding pass catcher, quickly transitioning from pass catcher to runner…his 83 catches in 2018 were a Pac-12 record for a running back (six career games with 10-plus catches)…only three career fumbles…persevered through a rough upbringing and is no stranger to overcoming adversity.","YEAR (GP/GS) CAR        YDS      AVG TD         REC      YDS       AVG TD     NOTES 2015: Redshirted 2016: (13/2)    102     584      5.7    6       48       342       7.1   1    Freshman All-American Honorable Mention 2017: (13/3)    92      395      4.3    1       71       482       6.8   3 2018: (13/13) 122       560      4.6    12      83       613       7.4   4    All-Pac 12 Honorable Mention Total: (39/18) 316      1,539    4.9    19      202      1,437     7.1   8              HT       WT       ARM      HAND     WING       40-YD 20-YD 10-YD          VJ        BJ        SS     3C       BP COMBINE     5094     197      30 3/8   09 1/4   73         4.58  2.65  1.59           36 1/2    09’10”    4.25   7.01     -    (no bench – right shoulder) PRO DAY                                                    -     -     -              35        09’09”    -      -        15   (stood on Combine runs and shuttles)                                                                                      [27]  ",13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,122,560,4.590163934426229,12,83,613,7.385542168674699,4,.,.,.,.,.,.,30.375,9.25,73,4.58,2.65,1.59,36.5,118,4.25,7.01,.,2019,.,.,.,.,"WillJa08"

As a junior, he was named Mr. Football with a state-record 3,357 rushing yards and 43 touchdowns, averaging 240 yards per game and 10.6 yards per carry. In the 2012 state title game, Hurd rushed for 394 yards and seven touchdowns, completing a perfect 15-0 record. As a senior, he suffered a torn labrum in the 2013 opener and required season- ending surgery. Hurd ranked as the No. 4 athlete in the country and a top-40 recruit overall in the 2014 cycle, committing to Tennessee over Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State and several others.

He attended Eastern Christian Academy (Md.) for high school, which was basically a football factory created by Sills’ father (David IV). After playing through a broken knuckle in 2012, he earned all-state honors as a junior in 2013, but missed most of the 2014 season due to an ankle injury.

Hockenson was a four-year starter at Chariton as a tight end and safety. He was used as more of a wideout than traditional tight end in high school and the offense was centered around his receiving skills, finishing his career with a school-record 238 catches for 3,560 yards and 49 touchdowns. As a senior, Hockenson posted 85 receptions for 1,219 yards and 17 touchdowns, adding 39 tackles and two interceptions on defense to earn First Team All-State honors for the third straight year. He was also a standout basketball player, scoring 1,890 career points and earning Second Team All-State honors twice.

While his father was the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State, Wilson attended Starkville High for his freshman and sophomore seasons, throwing for over 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in five games. When his father became Georgia’s defensive line coach in 2013, Wilson transferred to North Oconee High, but missed his junior season due to injury. His father then became the defensive line coach at USC in 2014 and Wilson transferred to Serra High for his senior year, splitting the quarterback duties with Khalil Tate and also seeing snaps at tight end (310 receiving yards, seven touchdowns). He also played basketball at all three high schools. Wilson was ranked as the No. 82 pro-style quarterback in the country and he initially committed to Old Dominion (his only FBS-level offer) as a quarterback before choosing to walk on at USC as a tight end, redshirting in 2015. However, Wilson’s father was fired from the Trojans’ coaching staff after the 2015 season and Wilson elected to transfer because his tuition was no longer paid for as the son of a school employee. He transferred to UCLA and was immediately put on scholarship. His father was a two-time All-American (1990-91) at Oklahoma and was drafted in the 12th round of the 1992 NFL Draft. He most recently spent three seasons (2016-18) as the defensive line coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Wilson elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.

He played on the defensive line as a freshman at Hamilton before moving to the offensive line for his final three years of high school (mainly at tackle, but he also saw reps at center and guard). He wrestled as a freshman but that was the only other sport he played in high school. He was only 230 pounds as a senior and didn’t have the grades to qualify, leading him to Glendale Community College for the 2014 season. He transferred to Mesa Community College for two years but sat out the 2015 season to focus on academics and to take care of his mother, who was diagnosed with cancer (she’s now cancer free but is dealing with other ailments). He practiced at defensive end during summer and fall practices, but when a starting offensive lineman was hurt in the 2016 opener, the coaches asked Tucker to move back to offense and he started the rest of the season at tackle. For his final two seasons of eligibility, he committed to FCS-level Southern Utah (his first offer) over Northern Arizona and Southeast Missouri State. Tucker played primarily at tackle (right side in 2017 and left side in 2018) but filled in at left guard in the final three games of 2018 due to injury. His father (Mark) was an offensive lineman at USC and seventh-round pick (No. 186 overall) of the Atlanta Falcons in the 1991 NFL Draft, playing six seasons in the NFL and 10 seasons in the Arena Football League.

With his sisters leaving home for college, Allen returned to Montclair for his senior year where he transitioned to defense, also seeing snaps at wide receiver. He helped lead Montclair to an undefeated 2014 season, including a third-straight state title, finishing his senior year with a state-best 22.5 sacks. With the move to New Jersey and the transition to defensive end, Allen fell through the cracks as a college recruit. His only FBS scholarship offer was from Buffalo, but he committed to FCS-level Monmouth due to its proximity. In the final days prior to signing day, Kentucky had a few decommitments and thanks to persistence from his high school head coach (John Fiore), Kentucky visited Montclair as they were scrambling to fill out their recruiting class. They offered him on the spot and Allen visited campus the next day, committing to the Wildcats. Allen is one of six kids, including his fraternal twin brother (Isaiah).

Williams was rated as the No. 17 defensive tackle in the 2016 recruiting class and the No. 4 player in the state. Growing up an Auburn fan, he initially committed to the Tigers during his junior season, calling it a “dream offer.” However, he flipped to Alabama six months later before the start of his senior year after attending a recruiting camp at Alabama. Williams’ mother (Marquischa) passed away from cancer (August 2010). His older brother (Quincy) played linebacker at Murray State. Williams elected to forego his final two seasons of eligibility and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.","Explosive get-off to immediately reset the line of scrimmage…controlled, cat-like quickness to win off the snap, redirect or close in short-areas…lateral agility and clean weight transfer as a pass rusher…uses a variety of swipes, rips and club moves to break the rhythm of blockers…naturally powerful and creates surge with his upper body…produces knockback and steers blockers where he wants…uniquely skilled at keeping blockers off him, using hand tactics and length…holds the point-of-attack and doesn’t get moved…understands gap leverage and how to exploit it…comfortable two-gapping and handling double-teams…above-average ball awareness…sees through blocks and reacts to the ball, not the blocking scheme…accountable and “exemplifies all the things I talk about” on and off the field, according to Alabama head coach Nick Saban…works his tail off and owns a genuine love for the game…All-American 2018 season.

Oliver was considered a top-10 recruit in the country and was courted by all the top programs, including LSU (his dream school). However, he had his heart set on hometown Houston since his sophomore year because that is where his older brother (Marcus) played on the offensive line (Ed Oliver: “I was going to play football with my brother.

Tragically, his grandfather was killed (while face-down on the ground) when the rifle of a SWAT team officer accidently went off during a raid by police (January 2011), who were searching for Stamps’ stepson. Wilkins moved back to Springfield and initially attended East Longmeadow High School before moving to Suffield Academy (Conn.), which is 11 miles from Springfield, just over the state border. He repeated his freshman year and spent four years at Suffield, starring in football, basketball and track. On the basketball court, he was a four-year letterman and became the fourth player in school history to eclipse 1,000 career points. On the football field, Wilkins posted 71 tackles, 22.0 tackles for loss and 8.0 sacks as a senior, finishing his prep career with 253 tackles, 69.5 tackles for loss and 28.5 sacks in 35 games. He was the No. 6 defensive tackle recruit in the 2015 class and narrowed his college list to Boston College, Clemson, Penn State, Ohio State and Stanford, choosing the Tigers.

On the football field, he played both wideout and linebacker, but academic issues kept him off the recruiting radar. Johnson enrolled at Dodge City Community College and combined for 215 tackles and 11.5 sacks in his two seasons, earning All-Conference honors both years. He was the No. 1 JUCO linebacker recruit and wished to return to the south, initially committing to Alabama (his “dream school”). However, Johnson was forced to decommit and look elsewhere due to class requirement issues that kept him from transferring to the SEC. He narrowed his choice to Arizona State and Texas, committing to the Longhorns. Johnson has two infant children (a boy and a girl) under one-year old.","“Wow” speed and flies around the field like a safety…quick to read/react, accelerating in a blink…above-average closing burst as a tackler…knows when to roll the dice, timing his blitzes to shoot gaps before blockers can recover…plus range and covers ground…smooth pedal and footwork when asked to play in reverse…violent play style and competes with the relentless mentality required...big voice in the locker room.","YEAR (GP/GS) TKLS TFL SACK FF PD                      INT   NOTES 2015: Dodge City Community College (Kan.) 2016: Dodge City Community College (Kan.) 2017: (13/7)    60   6.0   2.0      1     1           0     Texas 2018: (13/13) 90     16.5 6.5       2     1           0     Texas; Second Team All-Big 12; Led team in tackles Total: (26/20) 150 22.5 8.5         3     2           0              HT      WT ARM         HAND WING 40-YD 20-YD 10-YD                       VJ        BJ        SS      3C      BP COMBINE     5117 226 31 1/4 10 1/4 76                4.43      2.63 1.60             33 1/2    10’01”    4.57    7.15    16 PRO DAY     N/A (stood on Combine numbers; positional drills only)  ",13,13,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,90,16.5,6.5,2,1,0,31.25,10.25,76,4.43,2.63,1.6,33.5,121,4.57,7.15,16,2019,.,.,.,.,"JohnGa02"

Williams is the youngest of three siblings, including an older brother (Rodarius), who is currently a starting cornerback at Oklahoma State.
